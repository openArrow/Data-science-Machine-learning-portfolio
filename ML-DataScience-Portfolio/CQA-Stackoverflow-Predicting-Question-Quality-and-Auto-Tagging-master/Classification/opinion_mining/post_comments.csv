88576,"Yes $F$ is self-similar exactly as Anton described.  Writing $F_{10} = \{x\in F \mid x_0=1 x_1=0\}$ and $F_0 = \{x\in F \mid x_0 = 0\}$ we have $F = F_{10} \cup F_0$.  Furthermore $F_0$ is a rescaling of $F$ with coefficient $\frac 13$ and $F_{10}$ is a rescaling of $F$ with coefficient $\frac 19$.  (This is just a fleshed-out version of Anton's comment.) The self-similar mappings are $F_{10} \to F$ $x\mapsto 9x - 6$ and $F_0 \to F$ $x\mapsto 3x$. Maybe I should clarify my follow up question: is $F$ in question a self-similar set? If so what are the self-similar mappings? Presumably the subscript $n$ on the last $x$ should be $n+1$.  Then at stage $n$ of the usual middle-thirds construction of the Cantor set when you have $2^n$ intervals of length $1/3^n$ each the number of those intervals that meet $F$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number (if you index the Fibonacci numbers appropriately) which is asymptotically a constant time $\phi^n$ where $\phi$ is the golden ratio $(1+\sqrt 5)/2$.

88581,"Vaughn thanks. The wikipedia reference is very much in the direction I was looking for. I also edited as you observed. 
 I guess you mean that $\theta$ can depend on $z$?  (Rather than on $\theta$.) Also your original rotation should be $f(z) = e^{i\theta} z$ and I assume that in your definition of a new map $f$ you want $f(z) = e^{i\theta(z)} z$. If I understand your definition then this is an incredibly large class of systems and there's essentially no hope of a complete answer.  Two remarks jump out:  (1) to talk about ergodicity you need an invariant measure.  A more meaningful question might be whether or not $f$ is *uniquely* ergodic.  (2) the maps you define are degree 1 maps of the circle.  If you put a few more restrictions on $z$ so that they must be homeomorphisms then there's a very rich theory of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the circle. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_number for instance. Also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_map gives some idea of the richness of behavio"

I'm not a specialist but it seems to me that for reasonably nice kernels (e.g. Hilbert-Schmidt) the natural approach should be: pass to the limit in the decomposition for finite dimensional approximations and show that the sequence of factors admits a converging subsequence.   Pietro Majer: Matrixes can not be decomposed in a product of upper triangular and lower triangular matrices (look up Bruhat decomposition). You have to allow permutation matrices.

It is not true that weak equivalences satisfy the calculus of fractions in general but this does hold after you apply the homotopy relation. Another good resource is the nLab article. Unfortunately I don't know how to make $W$ admit a calculus of fractions itself before applying the homotopy relation. Indeed this is one of the main motivations for having a model category to begin with- to avoid the calculus of fractions and set-theoretic concerns. There is something called a ""three-arrow calculus"" which works in any model category.  This is formalized in the book by Dwyer Kan Hirschhorn & Smith (AMS monograph.)

Do you mean that you want to close up a 3D manifold with boundary? It seems to be a question related to ""prescribing Ricci curvature"".

88686,"Thank you all very much for your helpful comments. In the real case you need to change the definition of recurrence: there's 0 probability of ever hitting any specific point so you look instead at recurrence to a neighbourhood (i.e. a random walk is recurrent if for each initial point $x$ and for each $\epsilon > 0$ the walk almost surely returns to an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$. With this definition the results are the same as in the discrete case: the random walk is recurrent in 1 and 2 dimensions; and transient in 3 dimensions or higher. That was very helpful. Thank you very much. A related result is Rayleigh's theorem: start at the origin in the plane and make $n$ steps of length one with directions chosen independently and uniformly at each step.

The ""all $N$"" clause seems to indicate that he is including composite $N$ but for non-prime $N$ there are more than two cusps; maybe he just meant that there are only cusps. He refers to a paper of Ogg where the latter says that the then-known list up to $N=163$ ""may very well be a complete list"" of non-cusp points. Nowhere does he prove what you claim in the first sentence. Mazur does prove that if $N$ is any integer $\geq13$ then the only $\mathbf{Q}$-rational points on $X_1(N)$ are the cusps.

The $a_i$'s need not be different however. When $m\geq 4$ this should be impossible by Mason-Stothers. Zaimi: Can you expatiate?"

See the paper of Deligne and Illusie (easy to recognize on MathSciNet) for some positive results and probably some references to the older literature (papers of Igusa and Serre I think) for counterexamples.  Two more things: for smooth proper families of curves its easy to see that the genus is constant and hence that the $h^{pq}$s are constant using the theorems on cohomology and base-change from the end of Chapter III of Harshorne.  And one place ... ... that the argument you gave for constancy of $h^{pq}$s in char. $0$ can be found is Deligne's article on the degeneration of spectral sequences.

One should mention the dimension of the centralizer algebra for a permutation module is the number of orbits of the group on ordered pairs.

89001,"You are asking about plethysms. Wilberd van der Kellen's is right but there might be some more to say here. The perspective in the plethysm literature is usually to write a composition of two Schur functors as a linear combination of other Schur functors -- like describing a ring by giving a multiplication table for basis elements. It might be interesting to think about describing this ring by generators and relations instead. Some plethysym relations in special cases are known and every few years a new paper comes out with another special case.  This is known to be a hard problem in general.

On the other hand it's not an $X\times X$ plane unless one $X$ is 4 and the other $X$ is 6. I'm assuming a combinatorial square is an arbitrary selection of $k$ rows and $k$ columns.  A variant of this problem is discussed at http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/791/grid-k-coloring-without-monochromatic-rectangles It seems that you are asking about $K_{kk}$ case of Zarankiewicz problem (if you want a square only in blue).

89061,"I suggest consulting more than one textbook on Riemannian geometry. There are different ways to derive these formulas and you might find one approach easier to understand than others.

The OP does say at MSE that he is a postgraduate student I think in the U.S. that means graduate student. This question is both very specific and a request for a long tutorial. If of the first four names that come to mind Deane or Anton Petrunin or Sergei Ivanov or Robert Bryant wanted to type out a full explanation I would not feel that anything untoward had happened.

89077,"Do you have an idea of the answer for the (probably simpler) case of polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$? Jérôme A special case of your suggestion amounts to finding the degree 1 polynomials in ""closure"" which just means finding the points  x  lying in the topological closure of all the roots.  Off the top of my head I guess that to identify such $x$ one might consider whether the set $\{ f(x)/f'(x) | f \in S\}$ has $0$ as a limit point or at least something like that.  What has come up in various places is that one associates with a polynomial the probability measure on $\mathbb C$ which is equidistributed on the roots of the polynomial. Now the space of probability measures has a natural topology and limit points are usually very interesting and special; there are isolated points etc. Equilibrium measures of compact subsets arise this way."
89078,"Since the heat equation with the given condition has a unique solution and the convolution form is one of the solutions the answer is in affirmative.  Are you expecting a formula like $u(xt) = \int_\Omega k(x-yt)u_0(y) dy$ or something like $u(xt) = \int_\Omega k(xyt)u_0(y)dy$ ? I don't think something like the first formula can be true. For small $t$ such a $k$ would have to like the fundamental solution of the heat equation. At the same time $u(xt) \approx u_0(x)$ for small $t$. Near the boundary of $\Omega$ this cannot be possible.  This is possible inside the domain. For the Dirichlet problem that is indeed so (the question is copied from the formulation in the Krylov's book). The case of the Neumann condition must not be utterly different - one should study the existing literature to have a precise formulation."

Find the maximum time t_1 such that there exists a circle of radius R that contains rho(t) for all t in the interval t_o < t < t_1.  So now we have a second point r_1 = rho(t_1) on rho. These two points are a distance R apart.  

Then repeat: Find the maximum time t_2 such that there exists a circle of Radius R that contains rho(t) for all t in the interval t_1 < t < t_2.  Repeat for all positive integer i. We can ""turn"" this procedure ""around"" to negative integers.

One thing you can do is jazz up the intro and abstract to point out that you are *for the first time* applying technique X to field Y and it fairly easily yields the solution to open problem Z. Thus the importance of the paper is not the difficulty of the proof but the introduction of technique X. This sort of paper has the potential to be widely cited as other researchers in field Y start to use technique X so I think a good journal is very appropriate.

89229,"Perhaps something like this would work? The ideal sheaf $I_Y(m)$ is generated by global sections for $m\gg 0$ by Serre's theorem. Fix such an $m>0$. Note that the general element in the linear system $H^0(I_Y(m))$ is smooth away from $Y$ by Bertini's theorem. So you are reduced to showing that the general element is smooth on $Y$.
 For curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ the following argument works: taking cohomology of the conormal sequence shows that global sections of $I_Y(m)$ give global generating sections of  $N_Y^*(m)$ which is a vector bundle on $Y$ since $Y$ is assumed smooth. But general sections of $N_Y^*(m)$ do not vanish on on $Y$ (since such such loci have expected codimension 2).  In case the complete intersection argument isn't obvious if the variety is a complete intersection then if one of the generators had vanishing derivatives somewhere on $Y$ the tangent space would have a dimension too high and form a singularity."

More exactly is *strictness* of the initial object considered part of the standard definition? I am inclined to think not: that strictness of the initial object is considered more of a distributivity condition (it is equivalent to asking that $X \times -$ preserve the initial object). For example in my way of thinking $Vect$ has disjoint coproducts.  The standard notion of ""disjoint coproduct"" in the categorical literature asks that $U_i \times_U U_j$ is a (not assumedly strict) initial object for $i\neq j$ *and* that each coproduct injection is monic (i.e. that $U_i \times_U U_j$ is $U_i$ when $i=j$).

The injectivity of $\oplus_{\mathbb Z} E$ also questionable since is not really a direct sum of $A$-modules.

On input $n$ and $e$ my algorithm produces $e'$ and consults the oracle about $n$ and $e'$ and then outputs a minimum for $e$. The program $e'$ runs in constant time on it's input and we can hardwire this into its code and so I've reduced MIN for partial orders to MIN for linear orders in exactly the way you've requested. Are you claiming that my program $e'$ does not run in constant time $O(1)$? Jirka: You are right I missed this trick. (So any NP search problem is reducible to the promise version of $MIN^L$.)

Everything has irrationality measure at least 2 by the pigeonhole principle Anthony: Consider $x=0$ so that we want $\frac{p}{q} < \frac{1}{q^r}$. This has no solution for any $r \geq 1$ when $p \neq 0$. The statement of the question should say that $\frac{p}{q} \neq x$ then it follows that all rationals have $\mu(x) = 1$."

complex by taking a thickening of some embedding in 
Euclidian space. So for example any $k$ dim'l complex has 
the homotopy type of a $n=2k+1$  manifold which is the boundary
of a contractible $n+1$ manifold. Tom I am struggling to make the notion of an intersection product precise. Is triviality of the intersection product based on the fact that $B$ has trivial normal bundle in $W$ or does the contractibility of $W$ get used? Every cycle in $B$ is the boundary of a chain in $W$. So basically given a $p$-cycle and an $(n-p-1)$-cycle in $B$ their intersection is the boundary of the intersection of a $(p+1)$-chain and an $(n-p)$-chain in $W$ so the boundary of a $1$-chain so a homologically trivial $0$-chain. To make this rigorous I guess you would need to say something about Poincare duality and compactly supported cohomology.

 I disagree with Jim's comments on the usefulness of having explicit polynomials. Nowadays you can feed these to software systems and get cohomologies local cohomologies associated to stratifications and such all directly applicable to representation theory.  The clarification helps but a reference to the known results would also be helpful. It would help to include a reference for the special cases you quote.   Aside from that is it clear that explicit descriptions of these varieties by polynomials will make it easier to apply them to character theory or such?

For continuous functions it is easy to check that the limit holds even pointwise since $|u| = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \chi(\xiu)^2 d\xi$ and it is just pushing integrals around and justifying a few Fubini's. (b) If $u\in D'$ you don't necessarily have that $|u|$ is some well-defined object in $L^1_{loc}$. For example what is $|\delta'|$? So perhaps what the equation is doing is giving $u$ a priori some regularity so that the absolute value of $u$ is well-defined.  Ah your desired expression appear in the ""Proof for (2.2)"" step. In (2.2) which is part of the statement of Theorem 2.1. So by hypothesis $u$ is $L^1_{loc}$. So you can probably use the result for continuous functions and Luzin's theorem to get convergence.

As an example it is easy to see that the maximum number is 1 if $p=1$ and it is $\ge 3$ if $p=2$.

The dimension of U is not mentioned in the question but its definition uses a linear subspace of finite dimension. oops! I interpreted the 'number of orthonormal vectors' as dimension. I thought that is the natural thing to do. In the convex cone case the answer must be p (dimension of the range). For the maximum number with $p=2$ to be $\ge 3$ you need the right side to be at most $(2/3) \|u\|^2$ not $\|u\|^2/\sqrt{2}$.  I suspect you're thinking about $\|u\|^2/2$. That's right. Thank you!"

Combining this with an elliptic estimate and Sobolev inequality one obtains the exponential convergence. However this constant is precisely some sort of Sobolev constant for the manifold it would seem and I'm not sure if that is the same as the constant for the convergence rate. Sorry meant $\partial_t \kappa = \Delta \kappa$ Looks to me like the convergence rate can be estimated using the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian (which as you say can be estimated using the Sobolev constant).

 $r(n)= \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}_qx^k.$

Very often there are two different recurrences as for the $q-$binomial coefficients. Some $q-$analogues have nice formulae others nice recurrences but only seldom they have both properties.
 Johann: and you don't think it is worth giving a special consideration to those ""doubly nice ones"" where both properties coincide? I don't think the comparison to complexification holds water.

Maybe it would be reasonable to start with the following a priori easier question: find a discrete subgroup $G$ of $SL(n\mathbb{R})$ and an infinite subgroup $H$ of $G$ so that $H$ is contained in the normal closure in $G$ of any of its nontrivial elements. [Clearly no residually finite $G$ has such a subgroup]. Igor a discrete subgroup need not contain a lattice. However any proof of non-simplicity would have to deal with Margulis-type phenomenon. For instance one cannot give a ""proof"" of the following type: Take a very proximal (i.e. both $\gamma^{\pm 1}$ have maximal eigenvalue of multiplicity 1) element $\gamma$ of a discrete group $\Gamma$. Then take the normal closure $N$ in $\Gamma$ of $\gamma^m$ for large $m$. Then $N$ is a proper normal subgroup of $\Gamma$.

90123,"isn't this problem harder than graph bi-partition? Well I don't have a formal proof now but I think that it should be NP-hard. Take a look at problem GT12 of Garey and Johnson which is quite similar. In that problem the instance is a graph $G$ and a smaller graph $H$ and the question is whether you can partition the vertices of $G$ into isomorphic copies of $H$. Intuitively the fact that the vertex set of both copies are not necessarily disjoint should make the problem harder.  Thanks Hebert. GT12 is different since the required isomorphism is fixed by graph $H$. "

Since $D$ is self-adjoint and only the connection differentiates anything there should be an easy symbol argument which shows that $D^2 - \nabla^* \nabla$ is $0$th order.  The mystery to me is why the difference is the twisting curvature of $\nabla$ plus the scalar curvature.

Clearly they are not commensurable. (BTW this example also shows that linearity is not a q.-i. invariant). Alan makes a very good point: You cannot allow more than one factor in your Lie group which is locally isomorphic to $SL(2 {\mathbb R})$. Otherwise your lattice $\Gamma$ will have two factors commensurable to $F_2$ and one can hardly make any conclusions. However once you exclude (more than two) $SL(2 {\mathbb R})$ factors and higher rank factors the Burger-Moses phenomenon does not occur and you get QI rigidity for $\Gamma$.  Thank you Alain and Misha.

This should also answer the second question.  Your formula g(ab)=gagb is only valid for group elements g not for their formal sums. If you want a formula for formal sums you'll have to use the comultiplication of the coalgebra $k\left[G\right]$. Maybe but there is certainly some confusion."

Plus the elementarity scheme $\forall \vec x\in T\ \varphi(\vec x)\leftrightarrow\varphi^T(\vec x)$. Do you want $T_1$ to be transitive in $T_2$? That is can $T_2$ have new members of some $\tau(x)$? Transitivity would mean: $\forall xy\ y\in \tau(x)\rightarrow \exists z\ y=\tau(z)$. In my suggested system this amounts to saying that $T$ is a transitive class. "

A second empirical procedure for finding the exponents was discovered by H. M. Coxeter. He recognized that the exponents can be obtained from a particular transformation $\gamma$ in the Weyl group which he had been studying and which we take the liberty of calling a Coxeter-Killing transformation in the following manner (see [5] ): Let h be the order of $\gamma$. Coxeter observed that (1) $ h$  satisfies  $ hl = 2r$ where $r$ is the number of positive roots
(2)   $m_i \le h$  for all $i$ and 
(3) the eigenvalues of $\gamma$  are $\omega^{m_i}$  where $\omega=e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{h}}$  A proof of (2) and (3) would provide among other things a proof of duality in the exponents $m_i$ observed by Chevalley (see [3] p. 24) since non- real eigenvalues of $\gamma$  necessarily occur in conjugate pairs.

It's just one of those terms that always confuses me (algebras have more structures than rings but Hopf rings have more structures than Hopf algebras). Did you trace through Macdonald's ""Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials""? I think something of what you need must be contained in the relevant chapter there. I thought Hopf means having a product and a coproduct. You choose to dualise one of your products? VladimirDotsenko: Having a product and coproduct makes it a hopf algebra.

The special fiber should indeed just be the smooth quartic rational curve in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and I don't see where any nilpotents could come from.  I think the issue was in fact due to failing to saturate the ideal so that your description of the ideal didn't actually provide generators for the ideal in the local charts he was working.  Playing around in Macaulay I can't get any of the cohomology groups to jump whatsoever.   Perhaps this is the right way to fix the exercise:  instead of looking at $H^i(tI_t)$ look at $H^i(tI_t(1))$.  This clearly jumps over $t=0$ as there the curve lies in a plane while it is nondegenerate for other $t$. Thanks for your kind check with Macaulay.

The version of semiring that I have been using is an additive commutative monoid and a multiplicative monoid related by the destributive law and 0 annihilates over multiplication.

I would specify that n is a new element commutative over R like a standard polynomial extension though R not necessarily commutative.

With distributivity specified does the above extension and quotient of the semi-ring always work or are there other problems?

Also it seems like creating additive inverses should have a proper name ... Even if it is distributive you are right that it can't always work. I can see how some semirings (like Max-plus) only can have inverses when quotiented with itself making a trivial ring."

As an abelian category $\text{Rep}(G)$ (say over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$) is just $\text{Vect}^n$ where $n$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $n$.  Since every finite group embeds in some symmetric group it seems very doubtful that anything meaningful can be done to compare their representations (which I assume are taken in characteristic 0).   For instance all symmetric group representations are realizable over the rational numbers which is quite unusual for other finite groups.

Banach manifolds are a useful tool for *studying* infinite dimensions and actually proving anything because there you have the implicit function theorem.

90673," Notice that $M$ is Haken ($T$ is obviously incompressible) maybe hierarchy of $M$ works to give a prove that it is impossible to find such an example... All you need is to observe what happens to rank of H^1 after this operation.  Misha  that is in some sense the first idea in my head. I just hope homology work to decrease the first Betti number under the surgery. But let us have a look at an example: mapping torus with monodromy map (21;11)---- we call this mfd $M$ $\beta_1(M)=1$. If we cut $M$ along the torus fiber we obtain $T^2\times I$ then glue two solid tori suitablely you can get $M_1 =S^1\times S^2$. $\beta_1(M_1)=\beta_1(M)=1$ ! Maybe you have another way to use homology...   I agree that $M$ must be Haken but $T$ need not be incompressible.  Consider the $S^2$ in $S^2\times S^1$ and then trivially increase the genus of this separating 2-sphere.  (I'm assuming that by ""nonseperable"" you mean simply non-separating.)

 Thanks. Yes I'm precisely interested in the `homotopy symmetric power' of dg modules over cdgas/simplicial commutative rings.

I'll try to summarize what I've gathered from this page and would appreciate if anyone either corrected or affirmed what I say. Summary: given a dg module $M$ over a cdga $A$ in characteristic zero we can form the `homotopy' or `derived' symmetric power $Sym^{p}M$ which is the derived coinvariants of $\Sigma_{p}$ acting on $M^{\otimes p}$. If we know the homology of $M$ then we can compute the homology of $Sym^{p}M$ using a spectral sequence $$H_r(\Sigma_n; H^s M^{\otimes n}) \Rightarrow H^{s-r} Sym^p(M)$$ as Tyler explains below.

The terminal object T is the (labelled) hypergraph with one vertex and
two hyperedge labels 0 1 which are mapped to the two possible subsets of the same size.
For every hypergraph G the vertices must map to the single vertex

Note further that if $G$ is the complete graph then by the above every such subset DOES induce 24 (or 12) paths. So what do you mean? I interpret the question as follows: take all the 4-subsets of vertices and count as a hit each of those for which the induced graph on those 4 vertices is isomorphic to a 4-path.

The complete graph has a count of 0 because every 4-subset of the vertices induces a complete graph not a 4-path. Yes by induced subgraph I mean the usual - you include all the edges in the original graph involving the four vertices.  For a complete graph you get a count of zero.  One can do better.
By a path I mean what is usually meant by a path in Graph Theory.

Imagine now that this is the bottom square of a soon-to-be cube and place $$G_0 \to G$$ ""above this square"" and form all the other (weak) pullback squares you can until you have a cube. Some of these will  be pullbacks of sets so actual $1$-categorical pullbacks but there will still be $2$-categorical one as well. (cont"
91039,"just curiosity what is $H?$ I assumed at first that it was Shannon entropy but then it doesn't type-check: t/n is a number not a probability distribution. I think its the binary entropy function. $H(x) = -x\log x - (1-x)\log (1-x)$. Ah that makes sense.  Thanks VSJ. The lower bound of Gilbert and Varshamov for binary codes is the first example that comes to mind.  For a maximal code of length $n$ and distance at least $t+1$ the Hamming $t$-balls cover Hamming space so there are at least $2^n / A$ of them where $A$ is the number of points in each ball.  Now use your formula to obtain the asymptotic behavior of this bound.

91042,"I edited your latex and made the notation a little more standard. Thank you David Roberts. [Updated comment (after Aaron answer)] Let us call P to your proposal for positive cone. Since P is closed under addition in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and it contains the neutral element it is obvious that we have a partially ordered group under the following order definition: $x \leq y$ iff $x - y \in P$. Thus it is enough to check that this order is a lattice i.e. every two elements have an infimum and a supremum. I thought this could be straightforwardly checked but as Aaron says in his answer this is not the case; e.g. there is no infimum of $(ab)$ and $(cd)$ when $ad$."
91043,"The point of my previous comment was that the roots of $f(x)$ are numbers of degree 4 over ${\mathbf Q}$ that are not constructible. The field generated over ${\mathbf Q}$ by a root has no quadratic subfield since that would lead to a subgroup of the Galois group with index 2 and in $A_4$ there are no such subgroups.
 A constructible number necessarily arises from a tower of quadratic extensions (which are automatically Galois) so the Galois group of its minimal polynomial has a composition series consisting of copies of $C_2$. The rest is a straightforward exercise in Galois theory and not appropriate for MO; perhaps you should ask at math.stackexchange.com.  GH: that is false. For example the root of an irreducible polynomial of degree $4$ with Galois group $S_4$ is not constructible.  Qiaochu: You are right. I should have said ""if and only if the splitting field of its minimal polynomial has degree equal to a power of 2"".

If it were a prime $p$ then $p=0$ in A/M so $p$ is in M. But as a (diagonal) sequence in A $p$ has all but one nonzero coordinate. Use this and the fact that I is in M to show 1 is in M which is a contradiction. So char(A/M) = 0. You really should read about Witt vectors as Tom suggests. Although the construction in my previous comment leads to a (nonconstructive) field of char. 0 out of infinitely many fields of different positive characteristics Witt vectors are a mathematically more significant way to create fields (well domains) of characteristic 0 out of finite fields in a good (= functorial) manner.

In this case at each point the family of curvature circles depends on the normal direction but I think in general you do not get circles in all directions. It has to do with the way curvature circles rotate

The natural coverage arising from the local ring axioms is a pullback-stable coverage on $\textbf{CRing}^\textrm{op}$ but not a pretopology.

91434,"Hint: Doesn't the inequality you are trying to prove look very much like an inequality solutions to an ODE might solve...? There should indeed be a minus sign in the exponential. I suppose this is a little interesting since it involves the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality. Don't use the formula for the solution. Just use the heat equation itself. Differentiate the integral of $u^2$. Indeed it should be a decaying exponential and with the optimal constant. And Noam is right that you can get the desired inequality from the explicit solution. All of the terms in the Fourier series except for the first one decay even faster and the first term decays exactly at exactly the rate given by the inequality. Deriving the inequality directly from the equation is a good approach because it generalizes to appropriate variable coefficient heat equations as well as higher dimensions. Is the upper bound really supposed to be an *increasing* function of $t$?  Anyway the Fourier expansion seems to give a sharp bound"

No. You can easily design a Lip-$\alpha$ function such that the variation norm remains large when measured on arbitrarily fine partitions: $f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 10^{-\alpha n}cos(10^n x)$ is the classical example. However the variation norm of any Lipschitz functions tends to $0$ if you restrict the partition interval size.  "

Even worse a twist of $G$ in your sense need not be a torsor for any group whatsoever.  Here is a silly example: $G=\mathbf{Z}/5$ $X=\text{spec}(k\times k\times k')$ where $k'/k$ is a cubic separable extension. On page 98 of B. Poonen's notes www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/Qpoints.pdf it clearly states that the set of $k$-torsors is equal to the set of twists of $\mathbf{G}$ where $\mathbf{G}$ is the algebraic group $G$ endowed with its  right action  of $G$ given by translation. Aren't the twists of $\mathbf{G}$ the same as the twists of $G$? He means twists of $\mathbf{G}$ as a $G$-torsor not twists of $G$ as a variety. Ow I see. Well then it's clear.

91530,"When working with groups you are implicitly working in enough of second-order arithmetic to make the basics of model theory function. As such you have the categoricity theorem for $\mathbb{N}$. The lack of categoricity for first-order $PA$ occurs only because we cut back the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered (since this is a second-order assumption.) What I'm really trying to say here is that non-standard elements only seem to creep in when you throw out the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered. I believe that categoricity of $\mathbf N$ means that all copies of $\mathbf N$ look the same within the universe but not necessarily the same as the external standard $\mathbf N$?

Maybe the solution is that we work in second-order arithmetic in which all the finite sets (of integers) actually exist as opposed to set theory?

Arbitrary covers of degree $n$ correspond to homomorphisms $\pi_1X\to S_n$ where the image is just transitive.  No doubt this can be phrased in terms of something torsorish --- the answer should be approximately '$H^1(XY)$ where $Y$ is a transitive-but-not-necessarily-simply-transitive $G$-set'. That should have been 'Arbitrary *connected* covers of degree $n$...'  If you don't require connectedness you can also drop the transitivity assumption. There is a mistake in your statement.

91676,"Could you provide a bit more explanation for those of us who are not number-theory experts? Hi Joel. There are many intuitions about what ramification means but here is the easiest definition. Let $O_K$ be the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$. Then since $O_K$ is a Dedekind domain you can write $pO_K$ as a product $\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}...\mathfrak{p_n}^{e_n}$ where the $\mathfrak{p_i}$'s are different prime ideals of $O_K$. The prime $p$ is said to be unramified if $e_1=...=e_n=1$ (i.e. if no prime ideal appears more than once in the decomposition of $pO_K$). The most intuitive kind of ramification is by taking roots of $p$ (e.g. $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ ramifies at $2$) but ramification can appear in more subtle ways like this: the prime $2$ ramifies in $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. (in scheme theory this number-theoretic notion of ramification becomes the same as the geometric notion of ramification of maps between varieties.)

92099,"Samuel as for your question about how many isomorphic models of the standard model there are it doesn't have a very useful answer.  The simple answer is that there is as many as there are sets (in say ZFC) which is to say the class of standard models of PA is a proper class.  For each set $A$ just consider the model of pairs $(nA)$ where each $n$ is a standard natural number (properly coded).  With an appropriate multiplication and addition intepretation this is a model of PA.  That is why we usually count models (or algebraic structures) up to isomorphism only.

I am looking for a weaker condition since i would like just the two vector bundle to be isomorphic without caring about the flat connections. Ah I see I misread the question. It is a trivial remark but one should note that representations $\rho \rho'$ which are in the same component of $Hom(\pi_1(M) G)$ 
(in your case $G=GL(r {\mathbb C})$ but it works in general as well) are isomorphic as vector bundles. This gives a sufficient but of course far from necessary condition for an isomorphism of vector bundles. In particular you get finiteness of the number of isomorphism clases of vector bundles. E.g. in the case of $r=1$ it shows that all line bundles are trivial since $Hom$ is connected.  A correction: $Hom(\pi U(1))$ is connected if $H_1(M)$ is torsion-free otherwise it is disconnected.

For projective varieties $X$ pulling back a vector bundle $E$ on $X$ to the punctured affine cone $C(X)$ gives you the equivalence between graded locally free sheaves possibly with a twist and vector bundles on $X$. By using local cohomology of $C(X)$ with supports at the vertex and an excision move you can sometimes relate it directly to the cohomology of the punctured spectrum where you have tools such as depth available.  Problems over the punctured spectrum of an arbitrary local ring are usually more general (therefore harder) than the same problem over the punctured spectrum of cone of a projective variety. If you can solve a problem (e.g. splitting of vector bundles) over the punctured spectrum of an arbitrary regular local ring then you get it for free for the projective space but the converse is not necessarily true.

These are basic facts from analytic number theory hence your question does not belong to this site. Please read http://mathoverflow.net/faq Well GH contributed to the solution and set up the weaker hypothesis. The fact that no zeta roots have zero as real part follows from that no roots have 1 as real part via the functional equation.  Take a look at this thread: http://mathoverflow.net/questions/36299/the-wiener-ikehara-approach-to-the-pnt Not true peterfunctional equation will not get you there ! Serenicky Peter is correct. For $t\in\mathbb R$ write the functional equation as $\zeta(it)=2^{it}\pi^{it-1}\sin(i\pi t/2)\Gamma(1-it)\zeta(1-it)$. Note that everything on the RHS is never zero except for $\sin(i\pi t/2)$ which is zero exactly at $t=0$ canceling the pole of $\zeta(s)$. Since the RHS has no zeros the LHS has no z"
92303,"I know 1) is true because of the Inverse function theorem. Consider $n=1$ $F(x) = -x^2$. If $F_\delta(x) = (\delta-1)x^2 + \delta x +\delta$ is an admissible perturbation then $F_\delta$ will have a regular root near $x= 0$ while $F$ has no regular roots at all. So 2. doesn't hold in this example. "
92304,"Take an arbitrary defining ideal $I$ and replace it with $I^m$ with $m\gg 0$. This will not have generators of low degree. No but I assume the curve to be reduced and define $I$ to be all the polynomials vanishing on $C_d$. So I'm asking for rational curves that do not lie on hypersurfaces of small degrees. Then you should say you are looking for ""generators of the ideal"" not ""defining ideals"" Take an arbitrarily high degree curve in some projective space and take a general projection to a plane. But I need a rational space curve: $C_d\subset\mathbb{P}^{n\ge3}$. Not lying on hypersurfaces of low degrees. Am I missing smth? Are your curves smooth? If not there are many examples of the form $(s:t)\to (f_1(st):\ldotsf_n(st))$. Here the defining ideal can have arbitraryly high degree even for $f_i$ monomials. qui-vadis: I recommend you look at the article of Eisenbud and Van de Ven.  They consider rational curves such that $I/I^2$ has a particular structure.  That should be quite close to what you are looking for"

Cech homotopy might be of interest to you. Here's an example of what I mean by applying set theory. Kunen has shown that it is consistent with MA+not(CH) that there is a compactum that is hereditarily Lindelof hereditarily separable non-metrizable and locally connected. I believe it is still open whether PFA is consistent with the existence of such compacta.

And yes I am interested in Cech homotopy too."

I'd note in addition to the descriptions below of how to land at those precise relations that E and F in U_q(sl_2) are skew-primitive elements relative to the group like elements K and 1.  See http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/tenscat1.pdf section 1.27 for an explanation of the deeper meaning of skew primitive elements.

Also asked on http://math.stackexchange.com/q/124894/5363 chhan92: There is really no distinction between 3rd year real analysis or 4th year undergraduate level real analysis.

If you take the ""Moore Loop Space"" version where your maps have domain arbitrary intervals $[0a]$ then yes it's a monoid.  I don't think there is anything more interesting to say for a general monoid with an equivalence relation on it than M/~ is a group if and only if every element has an inverse up to ~ i.e. for any a there is a b such that ab ~ 1 ~ ba. If the equivalence relation ~ is understood a monoid M with this property is often called group-like. If you think hard enough about the failure of associativity in the ""monoid"" $\Omega(X x_0)$ you will eventually invent the notion of $A_\infty$-structure. One point that is possibly worth mentioning: if $E$ is an equivalence relation regarded as a subset of $M\times M$ then $M/E$ inherits a monoid structure iff $E$ is a submonoid of $M\times M$.  Of course this would only be a preliminary step in a real answer to the question."

92338,"Answer to 1) should be always true I think. However for 2) you need some sort of properness condition. More precisely if $F$ is not proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ then there is a curve $\gamma(t)$ such that as $t$ goes to infinity $\gamma(t)$ goes to infinity and $F(\gamma(t))$ goes to $c$. Since there can be only finitely many isolated solutions of $F(x) = c$your condition (2) will be violated. When do you say a map $F$ is proper? $F$ is proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ means that there is an open set $V$ containing $c$ such that $F$ restricted to $F^{-1}(V)$ is proper (i.e. for every compact subset $Z$ of $V$ $F^{-1}(Z)$ is also proper). E.g. $F := \mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}^2$ be defined by $u = x^2y - x + y$ and $v = xy$ (where $(uv)$ are the coordinates in the 'target'). Then $F$ is not proper at $F^{-1}(c)$ for every $c$ on the line $v = 1$.  Did u mean $F^{-1}(Z)$ is compact instead of proper? Yeah! Careless mistake ... Is it easy to show a map is proper?

What exactly is your suspicion about that? In http://maths.anu.edu.au/~andrews/book.pdf this appears to be on page 77. What's missing here is a reference for ""the standard theory of partial differential equations"" stating and proving a theorem on short time existence of the solution to the initial value problem for a nonlinear parabolic PDE on a smooth manifold.

92349,"The whole Gromov-Witten formalism works in quite great generality. The more delicate issue is whether the Gromov-Witten invariants have any enumerative significance. For $\mathbf P^2$ they certainly count curves but it's not obvious: one uses that since the target space is convex there is an honest-to-god fundamental class and moreover one can use the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_3$ on $\mathbf P^2$ and Kleiman's transversality theorem to guarantee that intersections are sufficiently generic. I don't know off hand under how general conditions it is known that GW invariants actually count curves. To answer Dan Petersen's question (not Ritwik's) there has been much work proving genus 0 GW invariants are enumerative e.g. for a Fano hypersurface or Fano complete intersection which is sufficiently general in moduli in about 2/3rds of the cases.

The proof given in Mumford seems to be pretty easy and natural. Is it easier than Reid's?
 Why should any proof of Noether Normalization be *non-elementary*? You just make an induction and manipulate polynomials look at their degrees etc. ... no deep and complicated ideas involved.

92357,"According to Maple $\hat{f}=C\frac{K_1(i\xi )}{\xi }$ where $K_1$ is a modified Bessel function. I think $K_1(i\xi ) = C_0H_1^{(1)}(-\xi )$ where $H_1^{(1)}$ is a Hankel function. Thus I'm interested in analytic extensions of the transform of $\frac{\xi }{H_1^{(1)}(-\xi )}$.  The question posed is to determine the Fourier transform of a specific distribution and not inverting convolution as your title suggests. BTW you don't need to invert the convolution to show equality of WF sets. Since the dominant term of the $\hat{f}$ is a constant and it is multiplying the fourier transform of $\mu$ we should be able to say that the WFs are same irrespective of we know $\mu$ or not. "
