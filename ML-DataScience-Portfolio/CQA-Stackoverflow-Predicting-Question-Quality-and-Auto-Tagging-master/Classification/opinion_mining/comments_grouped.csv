91338,"Strang in Intro. to Applied Mathematics gives a nice presentation on circulant matrices Note: at the time I wrote this answer Denis Serre's answer was temporarily missing an answer to the second part."
91340,"Thank you Byron!  That chapter seems to be exactly what I need."
91345,"This doesn't quite answer the original question. He wanted an example with no topological monoid structure at all. The reals with addition is a contractible topological group and you can add a new isolated point which is an absorbing element and it is a topological monoid of the above sort. But course it doesn't induce the Z/2 structure.  While this doesn't give a space X with has no monoid structre at all it does give a very elementary example where there is no monoid structure compatible with a given monoid structure on $\pi_0$. This avoids all but the simplest parts of the ""equivalence issue"" that Domenico was alluding to. It seems to me to be a satisfactory answer to the question if no one can produce such a space X.  Thanks Tyler! That example perfectly suits me! For my teaching purposes it is even better than a space with no topological monoid structure at all since it allows me to stress on the importance of the fact that a homotopy equivalence of topological spaces is promoted to a equivalence of $A_\"
91346,"What's wrong about just $1$ instead of $\chi(g)$? pm: It doesn't preserve the $k^*$ action so does not lift to PGL. Exactly that doesn't induced a morphism."
91347,"In other words the problem statement as written is incomprehensible. We can try to make some ""educated guesses"" but it'll be much better if you clarify the question yourself.  Exactly what submatrices you want to count? What conditions $u_1$ and $u_2$ have to satisfy? Why after choosing $u_1$ columns you want the next column not to belong to their span? This is the logic I have? Alas the OP seems to have abandoned the thread so I'm voting to close as ""no longer relevant""."
91352,"Steven: Some f.g. assumptions are missing."
91353,"Hi Neil thanks for pointing my attention to that. But I'm not sure that completely solves the question yet: it seems to me the answers there suggest that if such a space X does exist then one of the simplest examples of such a space is likely to be a tree; but it seems that the question whether there actually exist trees with no admissible monoid structure is left open. Or am I missing something? And there is... As it turns out every tree has a monoid structure.  Privilege one monovalent vertex as 1 and identify the edge incident on that vertex as [01].  So we can write the tree as [01]\cup T where T is a tree which intersects [01] at the point 0.  Give each edge of T length 1.  There is a canonical path from any point outside [01] to 0 which has now been given a length.  Let [01] act on itself by multiplication let T * T = 0 and for c in [01] and x in T let cx=xc be the point a distance of c * d(x0) from 0 along the path between 0 and x. I was thinking of finite trees; I guess this works as long as there is "
91354,"Right to the point. That is exactly what I was hoping for. Beautiful;) Glad to have been of use."
91357,"Since the blowing up is Proj of the blowup algebra $A$ which is generated in degree 1 the functor represented is the functor of invertible quotients $L$ of the pullback $f^*I$ of $I$ such that for every integer $n > 1$ the induced surjection $f^*\text{Sym}^n(I) \to L$ factors through $f^*(I^n)$.   Thanks. Can you add this as an answer (it is not just a comment) and provide some details? The map arrow in row 9 isnt reverse?"
91360,"Valerio this is precisely the construction that was linked to in comments above Ah OK. It's such a short construction that I think it takes more time to find the right link copy it... than write it down directly."
91362,"Ok thank you very much Mr Holt. Thank you Mr Holt for precision. I'm interested in this injection for $k$ non archimedean local field. You say that $PGL(2K)$ embeds in $PGL(3K)$ but is it true that $PGL(2nK)$ embeds in $PGL(2n+1K)$ ? I think the embedding $\mathrm{PGL}(2K) \to \mathrm{PGL}(3K)$ can be seen as follows : let $\mathrm{GL}_(2K)$ act naturally on the space of binary quadratic forms over $K$. If $g \in \mathrm{GL}_(2K)$ is such that $Q \circ g =\lambda Q$ for every binary quadratic form $Q$ then by taking squares of linear forms we see that $g$ fixes every elements of $\mathbf{P}^1(K)$ so that $g$ is scalar. Rajkarov: No. For example ${\rm PGL}(53)$ has no subgroup isomorphic to ${\rm PGL}(43)$. The 2- to 3-dimensional embedding is exceptional."
91365,"If you want it for *every* $g$ you are out of luck because then the shift must be continuous in $L^p(w)$ which happens only if $w$ is essentially constant (the minimum is comparable to the maximum). Whops I should have said it more clearly... no for me $g$ is of a particular form. A usefull (for me) example could be $g=1/z$ (after identifying $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\mathbb{C}$). An interesting class of weights $w>0$ for functions on $\mathbb R^n$ are the so called $v$-moderate weights that satisfy $w(x+y) \leq C v(x) w(y)$ for all $xy \in \mathbb R^n$ for some constant $C>0$. Here $v>0$ is another weight often chosen as submultiplicative. Then it follows from the unweighted Young's inequality that $L_w^p * L_v^1 \subseteq L_w^p$. For more on this have a look at

91366,"Thank you......"
91370,"Thanks for the remark about the choice of ""complementary subgroup""; it clarified things for me.  But I still don't see the surjectivity of the map from the surreals to the surcomplex unit circle.  I agree that in non-standard analysis there's a transfer principle but surreal analysis is different from NSA (I'll start a new thread on this: http://mathoverflow.net/questions/91646/surreal-numbers-vs-non-standard-analysis) and in any case it's not clear to me that bracket-based definitions of sin and cos are first-order. I don't even know what bracket-based definitions of sin and cos are.  In ONAG Conway only remarks that the obvious ones don't work. How do we know the map is surjective?"
91371,"Very interesting question!"
91372,"Thank you very I begin to see the pattern of the proof.  Though I do not need Korselt Criterion I shall prove it on the run so it's done.

But one big problem remains for me : why do $(an)=1$ ? for instance if $n$ would be $p^k(1+p^{k-1})$ the statement would be wrong since $a|n$.  Of course such a $n$ is not a caermichael number for $k \ge 2$ since it is not square-free but that's what I want to prove !  Finding coprimes is a recurring issue I cannot get rid of.

PS: Sorry for the answer I use another account to answer.  I didn't understand you can recover an account. If you are referring to the $a$ in my proof you *choose* it so that it is coprime to $n$. You can do this by the Chinese remainder theorem: for instance there is an $a$ such that $a\equiv1+p^{k-1}\pod{p^k}$ and $a\equiv1\pod{n/p^k}$; such an $a$ is necessarily coprime to $n$. You can avoid problems with involuntary creation of multiple accounts if you register and you can ask on meta.mathoverflow.net to merge your existing accounts. So you add "
91375,"Will isn't D1 more to the point than D7? We have (thanks to Noam Elkies) 3 4th powers that sum to a 4th power and (thanks to Lander and Parkin) 4 5th powers that sum to a 5th power. Guy says that for $k\ge6$ there is no known sum of $k$ $k$th powers giving a $k$th power.  Did your student ever turn in the paper on principal binary quadratic form plus monic cubic one-variable polynomial the sum representing all numbers? Gerry found it you are right.  I don't see why $G(k)$ is an upper bound for $n(k).$ Since every large $k$-th power is already a  $k$-th power I think they are irrelevant to the value of $G(k).$ Oh well. In Unsolved Problems in Number Theory by Richard K. Guy the closest thing is section D7 page 153 in my edition very specific your $x_j = j$ and $y = n+1$ Rufus Bowen conjectured no solutions. Does anyone know an all positive solution to $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = t^3?$ I don't think $10^3 + 9^3 = 12^3 + 1^3$ counts. $3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 6^3 \; \; \; 1^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 9^3 \; \; 3^3 + 10^3 + 18^3 = 19^3 \; "
91377,"Is there a Fourier transform in the category? I would guess that you would learn more by working out what the definitions mean in this simple case than by looking up answers. I don't agree with your definition of a categorified poset. I think this should rather be a $2$-category such that each hom-category is equivalent to the final category or empty (since a poset is a category such that each hom-set is a point or empty) or something similar. The process of categorification means that you ""climb up"" one abstraction level not just identifiying something below with something above. Martin I don't think he's using the word ""categorified"" in that sense -- he just means he's making or considering the poset a category. (-ify meaning generally ""to make"")  Martin Brandenburg: Maybe I misused the word ""categorification"": in the non-categorial mathematical literature a poset is a set (a 0-category) and the definition in my question is a 1-category: the elements become objects and the relations become arrows. It seems "
91378,"Is it possible to give a similar heuristic which explains why $\zeta^\prime/\zeta$ (v. its derivative) appears in the 1 level density of the zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions? Dear Terry this phenomenon looks like it should be universal.  The building blocks of all L-functions are conjecturally the cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{A_Q})$.  If $\Lambda_{\pi}(n)$ denotes the $n$th Dirichlet coefficient of $-L'(s\pi)/L(s\pi)$ a Tauberian calculation together with an analysis of Rankin-Selberg L-functions gives $\sum_{n \sim X} |\Lambda_{\pi}(n)|^2\sim X\log{X}$ so $|\Lambda_{\pi}(n)|^2 \approx \Lambda(n) \log{n}$ on average."
91379,"For a Gaussian the entropy is a constant times the log of the variance (or standard deviation) and contains no more or less information than that. It's only when you allow non-Gaussian distributions that the entropy becomes a more interesting information measure. One characterization of the Gaussian distribution (say of mean 0 and variance 1) is that among all distributions of given mean and variance it has the highest entropy.  So the Gaussian solves a maximum entropy problem.  But I suspect that's not the kind of thing you're after.  Could you clarify what you mean by ""of any use""?  "
91380,"Do you mean preorders rather than posets or do you require the spaces to be $T_0$ or am I missing something? Right you are I mean T_0 Alexandrov spaces or else I should say
preorders."
91381,"Looking back at your post
you ask for _useful_ functors ...
maybe the first example is a bit too trivial then. This is an extremely useful functor when composed with other functors on the left. In combinatorics one frequently takes an object (let us say a graph) constructs a poset (say a poset of certain sets of vertices) cuts off the bounds (to have a non-contractible space) and applies your Pos->Top functor. In some cases the resulting space is a wedge of spheres and the dimension and/or the number of spheres express some properties of the original object."
91383,"Chuck: The transition to prime characteristic is an intriguing possibility in this setting though usually delicate.   It's probably worth asking Bram Broer himself to explain his remark.   And there is some further work beyond this paper which adapts some of Broer's arguments about normality to fields of good characteristic:  Jesper Funch Thomsen J. Algebra 227 (2000).    Thanks for the comments -- I'll ask Broer directly."
91385,"A superb exposition is contained in the first sections of Bott's ''Lectures on characteristic classes and foliations''.  Thank you Johannes"
91386,"I don't understand; say N=1.  Then the prescription sin(2 pi N delta) = sin(delta) doesn't hold.  Maybe N can only be infinite?  In any case I'd like to see more details. Does one prove surjectivity using power series expansions of arcsine and arccosine? If not that way then how? Presumably: sin(2 pi N + delta)=sin(delta) Oops it should have read: sin(2 pi N+delta)=sin(delta) not ""sin(2 pi N delta)"".

Sorry! I have now corrected the typo in the original answer.

91387,"With your hypotheses the subspace is an effective divisor if and only if the ideal sheaf is locally free of rank 1.  You can use Fitting ideals etc. to see that the locus where the ideal sheaf is not locally free of rank 1 is a closed analytic subspace et cetera."
91388,"Thanks! One can prove this as follows: 1) The case $X$ affine $\mathcal{A}$ polynomial ring is well-known (projective space). 2) Then deduce it for affine $X$ but $\mathcal{A}$ arbitrary; using some closed immersion. 3) By gluing conclude the general case. # Is there a shorter proof? # Can you give a reference to this universal property in the literature? I also wanted to mention that this universal property *implies* the usual universal property of the blowing up: Namely if $\langle f^* I \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{O}_Y$ is invertible then one can show that there is an epimorphism $\mathcal{L} \to \langle f^* I \rangle$ which must be an isomorphism since both are invertible. This is compatible with $f^* I \to \mathcal{L}$. Thus we end up with a unique $Y$-valued point of the blowing up. The  arrow map in the row nine isnt reverse? Buschi: ? There is no arrow map in row 9."
91389,"Thank you! Very useful answer."
91390,"The paper gives email addresses for each author. You could try contacting them"
91391,"The sole purpose of this comment is to contain the word ""quasiorder"" (an alternative name for preorders) -- greetings to the all-seeing eye of google. A very nice answer thank you.  Though I think I've made the same error as P. May: My answer talks about *preorders*. Sorry about that ...  Martin: Could you include references to this if any? Martin: morally I don't think you've made an error. If the OP wants to learn this stuff one of the things they should spend time understanding is why it's OK to treat posets and preorders as essentially the same thing."
91392,"I guess I should occasionally reload my browser... This answer was not here when I started mine then I was interrupted and it took a while before I got back to finishing it... Sorry for the duplication but it might be worth leaving my answer there as it has some references. No problem. Your answer is certainly more thorough."

91396,"In the question and in the answers by Hans and by Denis Serre there are examples of how the 1st order terms can be eliminated. Transforming from divergence to non-divergence form as you mentioned or vice-versa is another technique. It is applicable if the equation is linear and the 1st order term satisfies an integrability condition that allows it to be expressed as in your formula. I am still interested in given a more general elliptic equation finding a form without such terms if one exists."
91397,"What do you mean by ""Spectrum of a Laplace operator is a quadratic polynomial""?"
91399,"There were Mathema There was Mathematics before Grothendieck. Type ""Sheaf theory history"" on Google and you will get a paper by Haynes Miller ""Leray in Offlag XVIIA: The origins of sheaf theory..."" with all information you will ever need!
Roger Godement Roger:  Thank you!  I will read this. Are you saying that neither de Rham nor Weil had anything to do with it? Just curious... It is a more interesting question and one that can be answered given Weil's collected papers whether Weil published anything about it. I recall that he did some road-testing of the sheaf idea around maybe 1947 and this was probably unpublished material/Bourbaki early drafting. Found it thanks"
91403,"It depends on what you mean by ""discrete Gaussian distribution"". For example if $\sigma \ll 1$ the floor will be uniformly distributed between the values $0$ and $-1.$ Is that ""discrete gaussian""?"
91405,"Perfect!  I can't tell you how much this helps my paper."
91409,"Thanks again BZ this explains it. I didn't know about Victor's paper and it does sound interesting (although no section 3.4 there :) ) I'll wait a couple of days to see if someone here has anything to add about the ""highest weight"" property  and I'll accept it. I'll add a reference to your manuscript when it comes out.  Hi David and thanks for the reply I need to absorb the theorem you mention. I wasn't expecting the flag variety to be that space. At least without specifying conditions like ""highest weight"" or similar that allow us to induce from the Borel in the usual situation but I guess this is hidden in your notion of smooth.

Also you're absolutely right I'm interested in (gK)-modules but it gets technical to write what an action of a Lie algebra on a Category is I guess I could edit my question and add references to Xin-Wen's articles or Baez-Crans and Roytenberg on the 2-vector space case. "
91410,"Thanks for this answer. I am familiar with the $N=2$ situation. Actually Silberger in ""PGL(2) over the p adics"" is more precise but omits even characteristic. An analogue of the Bruhat decomposition would be certainly convenient but I think that the Iwahori decomposition plus the Bruhat decomposition over the residue field should be enough to circumvent it via induction by steps. Actually if you looked into the history of the question you will see that I have described all this before I decided to make the question a little bit more catchy because of zero reaction;) I had not looked at the history... Howe's 1973 Trans. AMS paper ""On the principal series of $GL_n$ over $p$-adic fields."" concerns the types of (unitary) principal series. These are roughly speaking the smallest irreducible constituents of the above representation restricted to $GL_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ (I'm not sure it's literally the smallest). Howe shows that his type occurs only once and determines the representation. "
91411,"Interesting thought.  I believe Lions and Snitzman is the stronger paper (and I think the strongest result using this approach for constructing reflecting diffusions--Dirichlet forms people can do more general domains though).  I considered something like this but it seems like too much work both (as you said) in that it seems like all this theory of reflecting boundary conditions is not really necessary to answer my question and in that it would require me to expend a lot of unnecessary effort (albeit interesting effort as these papers have been on my ""to read"" list) to learn the material."
91412,"To be honest I prefer a public discussion. Just post your questions here or on AoPS (the SE forum moves too fast and is too overcrowded with people looking for help with their homeworks to run the discussion there but AoPS College playground is a nice place if you think that your questions are not OK for MO)."
91413,"Thanks Ira I couldn't have put it better myself ;). Thank you Ira. That helps very much."
91414,"Known special cases: Pietro Mongelli has a paper on the ArXiv which calculates parabolic K-Ls for Boolean elements and includes an answer to this question.  His paper extends an European J. Comb. paper by Marietti on parabolic K-Ls for Boolean elements for $S_n$.  (For $S_n$ Boolean elements are those Bruhat smaller than the longest transposition but the Coxeter generalization is not the obvious one.)  It is probably possible to use the Lascoux-Schutzenberger formula for ordinary K-Ls to extend Marietti's answer (at least for the question of being 0 or not) to all covexillary permutations. Jonah: As you observe the question seems quite difficult.   The answer might be of combinatorial interest but I wonder whether it would have any impact on the subjects in which these polynomials arise most naturally: representation theory and algebraic geometry.   (Deodhar's papers have had a lot of citations in those directions especially.)   Probably your question will have a reasonable answer mainly in very special cases"
91417,"Thank you Tara. Your approach gave me a wider perspective. However I wonder if there is a less-involved solution for this problem. If I could see the specific example you are looking at I might have more to say.  In complete generality I could only suggest the approach I would probably take.  (I don't know much about $\omega$-regular languages but in general I prefer working with automata to other representations of languages.) I think it's easy given a Büchi automaton to describe the finite prefixes of words accepted by the automaton.  So perhaps you could first find a Büchi automaton accepting your language?  (I think it's straightforward to do that from the $\omega$-regular expression.)"
91418,"But it's wonderful to see you participating on MathOverflow! I am also very happy to see you here. Your book is one my favourites. I think that the ""Séminaire Cartan"" to which Roger Godement refers is this one: http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1950-1951__3_ 
 If only send my greetings to Grothendieck is he still alive?"
91420,"Your question is ambiguous because $p_n$ is not uniquely determined.  Thank Felipe. Yes $p_n$ is not unique however I just call here $p_n$ for one of those. Dung Duong: I reworded your question to try to make it clearer. I hope that I haven't changed what you want to know. Try checking Ribenboim's book ""My Numbers My Friends"". It's very much a survey but if there's something to be said (i.e. if these are not open questions) it has the source. Your sequences are $A_0 = 0$ $A_1 = p-1$ and $A_n = (p+1)A_{n-1} - pA_{n-2}$ so covered by general linear recurrences."
91421,"I don't think Gross ever says anything non-trivial about reducible Galois representations in that paper. In fact it even surprises me that he proves (A) in the paper. Is the first line of the proof of (A) ""if the mod $p$ rep is reducible then just let $g$ be an appropriate Eisenstein series?"" [i.e. not even a cusp form]? Back in those days the assumption that the mod $p$ representation was irreducible was commonplace. I certainly don't know the answer to your questions by the way. It would surprise me a little if Gross' methods could say anything about the reducible case. Kevin: Thanks. Indeed in the first paragraph of the proof of Cor. 13.11 Gross says ""If $\rho_f$ is reducible [...] one can show using the theory of Eisenstein series that a form $h$ satisfying (2) also exists"" where (2) is the condition that describes a companion form and then briefly describes how to this in a particular case."
91423,"Nice spirals ! Regarding Q1 it will be probably hard to prove this is always the case given that it's unknown whether there are infinitely many Gaussian primes of the form $n+i$ with $n \in \mathbf{Z}$. So starting at $N+i$ and moving $+x$ we cannot exclude the possibility of hitting no prime. +1 for ""step on a plane"". Will you meet gaussian primes ? Is there something similar for Eisenstein primes? This plot shows some patterns: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EisensteinPrime.html P-Y: Thanks corrected. Just a remark: The Gaussian primes on any given path are either entirely in $2\mathbb{Z}[i]+1$ or entirely in $2\mathbb{Z}[i]+i$. Hi Joseph! If you fix your closed cycle (the shape not the location) it would correspond to a fixed pattern of prime and composite Gaussian integers along that fixed path. Perhaps heuristics might give the conjectural asymptotics for the number of such cycles with that shape in a disk of radius $M$ centered at the origin. Typo on the first line (Guassian). (I don't have edit privilege"
91424,"Thank you Liviu"
91425,"By ""reduced"" they probably mean a word in the/a normal form (there are different normal forms for the Braid groups). Then the assertion is true see the survey linked by Igor.  Not knowing how they define ""reduced word"" or ""reduced form"" I can only suggest looking closely at those definitions. Usually those terms mean that the words have no cancellation which is equivalent to the words representing the same element in the free group and that is *not* the same as equality in the braid group. The title of this question is very vague.  A better title would be something like 'The word problem in braid groups'."
91426,"Thanks Stephen. I was looking at the (maybe less useful) identity you get by applying Cauchy-Binet to $(A I)(I B)^T$. Just for the record that gives $\sum_{S T \subseteq [n]}{\det(A|_S + B|^T)}$ where $S$ and $T$ range over sets such that $|S| + |T| = n$ and $(A|_S)_{ij}$ is $A_{ij}$ if $j \in S$ and 0 otherwise and $(B|^S)_{ij}$ is $B_{ij}$ if $i \in T$ and 0 otherwise.

91427,"The Poincaré homology sphere $P$ is a counterexample right? It's the quotient of $S^3$ by a finite group $G=2.A_5$ acting freely by isometries.  Any automorphism of $P$ lifts to its universal cover $S^3$and is thus a coset of $2.A_5$ in the normalizer of $2.A_5$ in ${\rm Aut}(S^3) = O_4({\bf R})$; but this normalizer is $2.A_5$ itself so ${\rm Aut(P)}$ is trivial.  But for even $d$ the space $H_d$ of harmonic polynomials of degree $d$ has a $2.A_5$ invariant subspace that is an eigenspace for the Laplacian on $P$ of dimension asymptotic to $\dim(H_d) / 60 \rightarrow \infty$ with $d$.
 The Poincare sphere is also a Seifert manifold. I have to admit that I am a bit confused about how the Seifert structure fits in the above picture."

 Anton many thanks!"
91430,"Thanks.  This is indeed very helpful.  A month after I first post this question I found the local parametrization theorem in a book by Gunning & Rossi.  It's not very easy for me to follow but I'm trying to understand it."
91431,"After a bit of ingenuity to consider the space of closed subsets it becomes so easy! Thank you very much. By the way if I understand it correctly one should perhaps add $0$ and $1$ to each element of $\mathcal{F}$ to make sure they are closed in $[01]$ too. Indeed I'll edit the answer to reflect your suggestion."
91434,"Hint: Doesn't the inequality you are trying to prove look very much like an inequality solutions to an ODE might solve...? There should indeed be a minus sign in the exponential. I suppose this is a little interesting since it involves the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality. Don't use the formula for the solution. Just use the heat equation itself. Differentiate the integral of $u^2$. Indeed it should be a decaying exponential and with the optimal constant. And Noam is right that you can get the desired inequality from the explicit solution. All of the terms in the Fourier series except for the first one decay even faster and the first term decays exactly at exactly the rate given by the inequality. Deriving the inequality directly from the equation is a good approach because it generalizes to appropriate variable coefficient heat equations as well as higher dimensions. Is the upper bound really supposed to be an *increasing* function of $t$?  Anyway the Fourier expansion seems to give a sharp bound"
91436,"The main thing is that the equation must be a linear homogeneous elliptic PDE with sufficiently smooth coefficients. In spirit a solution to such an equation behaves analogously to a solution to the standard Laplace equation or the Cauchy-Riemann equations which are always real or complex analytic and therefore satisfy the unique continuation principle. But alvarezpaiva gives the right reference below."
91437,"I heartily agree that this is a very impressive achievement. I would love to see such a combinatorial statement say about trees as Michael Blackmon suggested that gives rise to such an $F$. Thanks for clearing up my (now patently obvious!) mistake."
91439,"I don't understand this question.  We have two different groups $H$ and $H'$ acting on the same set $S$.  What does it mean for these actions to ""coinicide""? Steven: $H$ may coincide with $H'$ even if $G\ne G'$. In general $H$ and $H'$ can act with kernels $N N'$ and the actions of $H/N$ and $H'/N'$ may coincide (i.e. these two permutation groups may be the same). 
 In fact the question asks for an algorithm of finding the intersection of two subgroups of $S_n$ (I assume the set to be finite). Each subgroup is given by generating permutations. I guess the problem is  
NP-hard (at least).  I couldnt understand why this question has a vote to close and then by accident my stubby finger hit to vote to close when I was checking the reason. Sorry. This is a good question.  I vote to undo my accidental vote.  Benjamin Steinberg:  The vote to close was mine for the reason given in my comment above.  I see now that the question is both meaningful and interesting though I continue to believe that the wording makes it "
91441,"I bet there are more general results about the set of points where a solution vanishes. How messy can a closed set in the plane be if it is the zero set of a solution? Empty interior if not whole plane but if it's one-dimensional what can it look like locally up to diffeomorphism? From what I remember (reading Bers' paper ages ago in mid-1990s) that in dimension 2 zero level sets are always locally diffeomorphic to zero sets of $Re(q(z)dz^k)$ where $q(z)dz^k$ is a degree $k$ holomorphic quadratic differential.

91446,"Actually my result unfortunately does not quite produce square cycles because I cannot preclude the existence of primes on the edges of the square with prime corners.  I can probably adapt the argument to exclude primes from a bounded number of places (by using a sieve to upper bound the exceptions) but the squares generated by the argument are quite large (the length of the square is comparable to the magnitude of the corners) and so it is actually rather likely that there are intervening primes somewhere along the edges. Beautiful observation that there are an infinite number of square cycles via Tao's result!"
91447,"Nice Greg you've addressed several of the symmetry issues that I now added as **Q3**.  Just a remark regarding Greg Martin's nice question (although I know this wasn't really the question): Ignoring the case of whether $M$ is itself a rational prime or not one way to construct a sequence $M^2+i^2$ all composite for $1\leq i \leq n-1$ is as follows: Consider $m^2+i^2$ $1\leq i \leq n-1$ for any $m\not=0$. Let $P$ be the product of all primes dividing these numbers and $m^{\prime}=m+P$. Then $(m^{\prime})^2 + i^2$ are all composite for $1\leq i \leq n-1$. In this case $m^{\prime}$ is the distance from one of the axes so it is in line with what Barry Cipra pointed out."

I am much too lazy to check anything at the moment but I'm pretty sure it works for H=K or H=\{e\}$ !

On the other hand this is maybe not as nice a construction as what you would hope for. Thx. What is $S.C(K)^H$? Well the product of these two subsets of $C(K)$ or if you prefer the $(C(K)^H)^{opp}$ submodule of $C(K)$ for the right multiplcation that is spanned by S (which is a $C(K)$-submodule for the left multiplication).

It makes the first loop 3 times as fast as the second so it must spend $1/4$ of its time traveling clockwise. So $g$ is of the form $e^{4 i \theta}$ on the clockwise portions and $e^{-(4/3) i \theta}$ on the anti-clockwise portions. So $g$ sometimes has speed $4-1=3$ and sometime has speed $1-(-4/3) = 7/3$. You're absolutely right. I guess what I want is the following: suppose that $g$ moves clockwise $x$ times as fast as it moves anticlockwise. Then it spends $1/(x+1)$ of its time clockwise and $x/(x+1)$ of its time anticlockwise. Its speed clockwise is therefore $1+x$ anticlockwise $1+1/x$. I want then that $1+x−1=1+1/x+1$ i.e. $x^2−2x−1=0$. Sean's example is beautifully simple. It definitely shows that $|a_1|$ cannot be bounded away from zero.

Poonen's notes www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/Qpoints.pdf it clearly states that the set of $k$-torsors is equal to the set of twists of $\mathbf{G}$ where $\mathbf{G}$ is the algebraic group $G$ endowed with its  right action  of $G$ given by translation. Aren't the twists of $\mathbf{G}$ the same as the twists of $G$? He means twists of $\mathbf{G}$ as a $G$-torsor not twists of $G$ as a variety. Ow I see. Well then it's clear.

Actually what I am trying to count is prefixes of Catalan Strings of length $p+q$ if my understanding of Dyck words is correct.

91496,"Isn't the infinite case much easier than the finite case (and in fact almost trivial)? Given two sets $AB$ of basis elements just write each element of $A$ in terms of finitely many elements in $B$ and since this spans we must use every element of $B$ somewhere so $B$ is a union of finite sets indexed by $A$ hence if they're both infinite $|B| \leq |A|$. Similarly $|A| \leq |B|$. 

Maybe when set theory wasn't well-developed this proof was less obvious but to me it seems likely that it's a sufficiently easy result it might not have been formally published but just remarked somewhere. The reference in Howard-Rubin points to L. Löwig who published a proof in this paper: matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/sm/sm5/sm513.pdf.

But the problem is that you get a sum over exponentially many geodesics and you end up trying to add up e^\lambda terms of size O(1) while the actual answer is also O(1). This is why it is so hard.

If $E$ stays above $1/n$ for $n$ steps then the total decrease of the $\ell^2$ norm is at least $1$ but it was just $1$ in the beginning. OK I'll write it more carefully just a bit later... Thanks this is what I was looking for. A concrete argument. However I still have problems to follow the steps. You call the $\ell^2$-norm of $P_n$ the energy right? Why does it drop by some constant multiple of $E$? I also do not understand the later parts of the argument. Not the $\ell^2$ norm of $P_n$ but the $\ell^2$-norm of its *two-step gradient*!

91530,"When working with groups you are implicitly working in enough of second-order arithmetic to make the basics of model theory function. As such you have the categoricity theorem for $\mathbb{N}$. The lack of categoricity for first-order $PA$ occurs only because we cut back the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered (since this is a second-order assumption.) What I'm really trying to say here is that non-standard elements only seem to creep in when you throw out the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered. I believe that categoricity of $\mathbf N$ means that all copies of $\mathbf N$ look the same within the universe but not necessarily the same as the external standard $\mathbf N$?

Maybe the solution is that we work in second-order arithmetic in which all the finite sets (of integers) actually exist as opposed to set theory?

They don't the issue being that your inclusions aren't compatible with the transition maps in the Tate module (which are multiplication by $\ell$)."
91545,"I think this is really the point.  When we say ""a natural number"" we mean a natural number in the current theory which includes any non-standard ones.  Most people don't bother to say ""by induction"" for ""obvious"" facts about N but almost always if you pressed them that's what they would say they meant.  This is the same as the rest of math; we can't write all the details or papers would be unmanageably long.  But that doesn't mean all proofs should be regarded as ""non-rigorous"" except in the sense that they still require ""compiling"" to become fully formalized."

For instance with the non-isogenous elliptic curves having the same $L$-series it should be noted that over the *rationals* elliptic curves with the same $L$-series are isogenous.
Another possibility is abelian varieties with a finite Tate-Shafarevich group of nonsquare size; for ell. curves the size must be a square but in higher dimensions that is false. See http://mathoverflow.net/questions/9924/order-of-the-tate-shafarevich-group. This should be CW."
91547,"I believe we have slightly different definitions. If a \emph{foliation} is normally hyperbolic and plaque expansive for a diffeomorphism $f$ then $f$ is (as a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism) robustly dynamically coherent. The problem with your second sentence is that in order to define plaque expansiveness at least for the definition I know (of Hirsch-Pugh-Shub) one needs that $f$ be dynamically coherent.  If there is no plaque expansiveness it is open whether perturbations of a diffeomorphism having a normally hyperbolic invariant foliation is robustly dynamically coherent.   rpotrie Plaque Expansiveness can be (at least formally) defined whenever the center foliation exists. And this is the definition in many references. Why would we need the dynamical coherence assumption to define PE? Also does the following work: if $E^c_f$ integrates to $W^c_f$ then $W^c_f$ is normally hyperbolic. So for $g$ close to $f$ $E^c_g$ also integrates to some $W^c_g$ (close to $W^c_f$). Thank you!

91553,"I feel like you're looking for something like the following.  Galois covers of a topological space $X$ of degree $n$ correspond to homomorphisms $\pi_1X\to S_n$ where the image is transitive and has trivial point stabilizers. Arbitrary covers of degree $n$ correspond to homomorphisms $\pi_1X\to S_n$ where the image is just transitive.  No doubt this can be phrased in terms of something torsorish --- the answer should be approximately '$H^1(XY)$ where $Y$ is a transitive-but-not-necessarily-simply-transitive $G$-set'. That should have been 'Arbitrary *connected* covers of degree $n$...'  If you don't require connectedness you can also drop the transitivity assumption. There is a mistake in your statement.  The group $H^1(XG)$ is in bijective correspondence with homomorphisms $\pi_1(Xx)\to G$ up to conjugacy.  The kernel is a normal subgroup but the quotient need not equal $G$ -- only a subgroup of $G$."

Note by the way that this shows that the maximum dimension of such an $L$ is $1{+}m(n)$ where $m(n)$ is the largest integer such that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a module over $Cl\bigl(m(n)\bigr)$. Thus $m(n)$ is easy to determine when $n$ is given by consulting the classical theory of Clifford algebras.  In particular $m(2k{+}1) = 0$ $m(4k{+}2)=1$ $m(8k{+}4)=3$ $m(16k{+}8)=7$ and $m(16k) = m(k)+8$."

Robert: I am curious how one could prove the statement you mentioned. Since ""closed form"" is not a well-defined term there no way to prove that this number does not have a closed form.  It might be more accurate to say that I don't know of a closed form for $\sum_{i=0}^\infty 1/(\exp(i)+1)$ and I'm doubtful that anybody else does. 
It would be $1/2 + f(1/e)$ where $f(t)$ is the generating function for OEIS sequence A048272 but the generating function listed at https://oeis.org/A048272 is in the form of an infinite series.

Formally it's about equally as difficult but the proof of the isotopy extension theorem is extremely intuitive.  The idea is if $F: [01] \times N \to M$ is a smooth 1-parameter family of embeddings consider the image of $\overline{F} : [01] \times M \to [01] \times M$ given by $\overline{F}(tp) = (tF(tp))$.  $\frac{\partial \overline{F}}{\partial t} \circ \overline{F}^{-1}$ is a vector field on this image so the idea is to extend this vector field to $[01] \times M$ and use the flow to define $G$.  Constructing the extension requires some bump functions.  The domain of $\overline{F}$ was supposed to be $[01] \times N$.  Er maybe I shouldn't try to explain the proof here.  It's in Hirsch.  "

Under some hypotheses (smooth and proper are sufficient but probably something weaker would work if formulated correctly) you can put a `Mukai form' on Chow so that the Mukai vector map $\v:Ch(?)\sqrt{td(X)}$ respects the pairing (basically this needs Riemann-Roch).

When $q$ is a power of $p$ and  $p$ is odd the Sylow $p$-subgroups of ${\rm GL}(2q)$ are elementary Abelian.  In the above I am talking about $p$-subgroups of ${\rm GL}(2q).$ Accepted for the simplest criterion. I never realised this nice fact about odd Sylow subgroups of $GL_2(q)$! 

As an example it follows from your answer that the only subgroups $A_n$ have $n\leq 5$ where we note that $A_5 \times C_3 \cong GL_2(4)$. Your arguments exclude the bigger ones since $q$ would have to be even resulting in abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups. This seems to suggest a general phenomenon where only ""small"" groups will arise. In general the Sylows will be unpredictable and probably non-abelian which gives a notion of ""almost never"

So this nicely encapsulates my approach in special cases.  E.g. if our generators are $x \mapsto x + 1$ and $x \mapsto 2 x$ you can say something like ""take a bunch of elements in $F_p$ with the same low bits when written in base 2"" since it still vaguely makes sense to talk about elements of $F_p$ in base 2; but this fails if you switch 2 for $a \approx p^{1/10}$.  So the generalization here is ""take elements of $F_p$ which have distance at most 100 from 0 on the edges:

$x \mapsto x + a^r$ for $0 \leq r < 100$""

which -- in hindsight -- is clearly the correct generalization. Well maybe ""distance at most 100^100"" or so."
91676,"Could you provide a bit more explanation for those of us who are not number-theory experts? Hi Joel. There are many intuitions about what ramification means but here is the easiest definition. Let $O_K$ be the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$. Then since $O_K$ is a Dedekind domain you can write $pO_K$ as a product $\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}...\mathfrak{p_n}^{e_n}$ where the $\mathfrak{p_i}$'s are different prime ideals of $O_K$. The prime $p$ is said to be unramified if $e_1=...=e_n=1$ (i.e. if no prime ideal appears more than once in the decomposition of $pO_K$). The most intuitive kind of ramification is by taking roots of $p$ (e.g. $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ ramifies at $2$) but ramification can appear in more subtle ways like this: the prime $2$ ramifies in $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. (in scheme theory this number-theoretic notion of ramification becomes the same as the geometric notion of ramification of maps between varieties.)

On the other hand however if the function is smooth I can't imagine what $\frac{\partial^n F}{\partial x^n}$ would look like.
 Oops $(xh_x+yh_y)$ should be $(xh_x+yh_y-h)$ above.
 Yes you should be able to show that if $h$ is smooth and vanishes at the origin then $F_{12}$ cannot be smooth due to the $3/2$ power."
91744,"Thanks for the example!  I think you are addressing a global rather than a local version of my question but this can easily be modified.  Germs of sections in the kernel of $\Delta$ are complex functions whose real and imaginary parts are harmonic.  Germs of sections in the kernel of $\Delta -n(n+1)$ are -- well I'm not sure; some infinite-dimensional space; but anyway your answer shows that their behaviour to $n$-th order is arbitrary.  Thus the sets of isomorphism classes of local rings of germs of solutions to these PDE are (presumably) not the same. By the way can you suggest a better criterion than the principal symbol? You can view a partial differential equation of order $N$ as imposing a linear constraints on the $N$-th jet. Thus you need to take in consideration the full symbol. In any case it seems very hard to predict what kinds of constraints  this induces on the  Eisenbud-Khimshiashvili   pairing."

91753,"Is it possible to be more explicit?  I don't see why the small perturbation on $a_2$ induced by the stem and blob can be guaranteed not to send $-1/a_2$ outside the blob---since the perturbation on $-1/a_2$ may be large.    The perturbation in $a_2$ is not large at all. When the stem width tends to $0$ the conformal mapping tends to the mapping to the original domain uniformly on compact subsets of the unit disk. Despite the blob is large its full pre-image is just a tiny piece near the very boundary of the circle which doesn't affect the behavior near the center. That is one of rather counter-intuitive properties of the conformal mappings. If you want I can post a full proof but you can just as well read some decent complex analysis textbook.  OK I see now---letting the stem width go to zero produces a convergent sequence whose limit is forced to be z/(1-az) itself. (So the blob is handled progressively later in the tails of the respective series.) Thanks for the answer.  "

The context is that an expert will articulate a prior in terms such as ""I am 50% confident that total error does not exceed $100000."" We can usually assume mode zero. It is not unreasonable to assume that the expert's implicit prior over the entire range of potential error is an exponential with 50th percentile = 100000 (and therefore mean = 100000 / 0.7).

It's not an answer but I'm pretty sure that this module was considered in one of Littelmann's path model papers. These $H^0$ for line bundles are basically Demazure modules and the Lakshmibai-Seshadri-Littelmann model for them involve paths that move in directions $w\mu w_1\mu w_2\mu ... 1\mu$ for some chain $(w_i)$ in Bruhat order possibly skipping some steps. The $Q(\mu)$ then have a path model where one does not skip the original $w$-step. Maybe you'd like the following point of view for inductive study: $H_w \equiv \oplus_{v\leq w} Q_v(\mu)$ as $T$-representations.

very nice answer thanks! Let me summarize and simplify a bit your argument:
Let M be a monoid; then: i) for each pair xy of invertible elements there exist a homeomorphism of M in itself mapping x to y; ii) either M is a group or there exist an element which has neither a left inverse nor a right inverse; iii) if M is path connected but M-{e} is not connected then all elements of M except at most those in one connected component of M-{e} are invertible.
Thus a monoid structure on the infinite ternary graph would give a homeomorphism mapping an edge internal point onto a vertex.  I played fast and loose with 2-sided invertibility but it doesn't matter.  Either:

-there is a point which is not invertible. The argument goes through as above.

With inclusion-exclusion one would get a $O(2^{\omega(p-1)})$ term so it seems this would allow one to circumvent that.

One can find necessary conditions e.g. the universal cover of $\mathcal{M}$ must be parallelisable. Sufficient conditions seem harder to come by... Pulling back the connection to the universal cover gives a necessary condition: that the universal cover is parallelizable. But this is not sufficient (or if it is a proof is not obvious.)

If you can define the functors on the DG level they can't suddenly stop being equivalences (after all for free resolutions quasi-isomorphism is the same as homotopy equivalence).  The thing that could go wrong (though it very rarely does) is that the functors don't lift. Most theorems that derived categories are equivalent are actually theorems that DG categories are the same with precisely the same proof.  It's just that derived categories appeared on the scene first and it took people a long time to realize that DG categories are a better notion.

Ah it would be circular if you didn't know what a regular function was. A function $f: X \to \mathbb{A}^1$ on a quasi-projective variety $X$ is called regular if $\forall x\in X$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f|_U$ is the quotient of two homogeneous polynomials $f|_U = F/G$ of the same degree such that $G$ has no zeroes on $U$.

Thanks a lot.  Ruadhai - would it be equivalent to say that a map $\phi:V \rightarrow W$ is a morphism iff for all $p \in V$ there exist affine open sets $U$ of $p$ and $U'$ of $\phi(p)$ s.t. $\phi(U) \subset U'$ and $\phi|_U$ is a morphism of affine varieties?

My previous comment misses the mark.  I think the problem with your example becomes apparent when looking at Thurston's commutative diagram on $\tilde U_i/\Gamma$. Kevin I think you're right. The problem was that I was ignoring the fact that things have to commute with respect to the inclusion map from $U_a$ to $U_b$ as well. If this is the case then my example no longer satisfies the conditions as the composite map $\phi_j^{-1} \circ f_{ij} \circ \phi_{ij} \circ \phi_i$ now maps $U_i$ two to one into $U_j$. "

Possibly some restrictions on direction. The difference is that it may be possible to show that there really are infinitely many primes $1 + y^2 + z^2$ for example.

The last equation is defined on the piece of boundary of $C_4$ corresponding to the parenthesization 1 (2 3) 4 which can be identified with $C_3$. I'm just trying to reformulate the usual way of computing the monodromy of KZ and proving the pentagon: you've an equation with $n−2$ variables on $C_n$ and when you take an appropriate ""limit"" (when you go the the boundary in an appropriate direction) you lost one of the variable so you get an equation on this boundary piece of $\bar C_n$ which is obtained from the usual equation for $C_{n−1}$ by applying some operadic operation."

If $\sigma_0+it$ is a zero and $\sigma$ approaches $\sigma_0$ then in the fraction the numerator and the denominator both approach zero.

A necessary and sufficient combinatorial condition (in this model) for $\{A_n\}$ to generate the full power set $\sigma$-algebra is for $\{A_n\}$ to separate points (i.e. for all $X \in [\mathbb{R}]^2$ there exists an $n$ such that $|A_n \cap X|=1$).  With this in mind Asaf's argument localizes in the sense that you can build $B_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $\bigcup_{n < \kappa} A_n = \bigcup_{n < \kappa} A_n$ for $\kappa \in \{12 \ldots \aleph_0\}$ and moreover $\{B_n\}$ separates points.

What if q=2 ? You write ""There is no good way known to map algebraic codes to complex constellations"" but why AG is worse than turbi&LDPC in this respect ? Would you be so kind to provide some references to the literature ?  Hi Alexander:
1) I believe AG codes will beat any other construction that lies below or at the GV bound for all alphabets q>49 for some rates (if the other construction even meets the GV bound for q<49 they will be theoretically superior to AG codes since AG codes do not meet GV bound below q<49).

[nLab ref for this](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad#the_bicategory__19)  I've used your terminology Tom.  Another good reason for calling these ""lax morphisms of monads"" is that there's a 2-monad on Cat whose algebras are ""categories equipped with a monad"" and whose lax morphisms are these.

92099,"Samuel as for your question about how many isomorphic models of the standard model there are it doesn't have a very useful answer.  The simple answer is that there is as many as there are sets (in say ZFC) which is to say the class of standard models of PA is a proper class.  For each set $A$ just consider the model of pairs $(nA)$ where each $n$ is a standard natural number (properly coded).  With an appropriate multiplication and addition intepretation this is a model of PA.  That is why we usually count models (or algebraic structures) up to isomorphism only. ""How many models of Peano arithmetic are there that are isomorphic to the standard model?""  One up to isomorphism. Two excellent references: 1. ""Models of Peano Arithmetic"" by R. Kaye.

If I'm not mistaken knowledge of the *entries* of the first row for $A$ $A^{2}$ $A^{3}$ etc is enough to reconstruct the whole matrix (at least so long as $A$ is not unipotent).  So I was hoping that knowledge of the row sums might at least provide some information about the dominant eigenvector.  But perhaps that's too much to hope for. Ian. An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ can be reconstructed from the vectors $x$\dots$A^{n-1}x$ if and only if these vectors span $\mathbb{R}^n$. But this is using $n$ times as much information.
Roughly speaking in your case you can reconstruct one entry of each eigenvector. Fedja's answer provides another way of viewing this point."

(3) Uniform lattices acting on some hyperbolic buildings. (4) Random groups (in certain regimes) are infinite hyperbolic with property T. Very recent: (5) Oppenheim's constructions.

92216,"Nice answer but I don't feel that you are getting to the heart of my question. Showing that the unit interval behaves well ""up to homotopy"" is presupposing the fact that we have defined homotopy using the unit interval. If we so to speak we were not already using $[01]$ to do homotopy theory then how could we identify the relevant categorical properties of $[01]$? By categorical here I mean expressible in the category of topological spaces and continuous maps (not up to homotopy). You need to be able to define 'contractible' somehow in order to make a lot of this machinery to work. In order to do that you need some sort of model category (not necessarily a Quillen one) or some sort of category with a cylinder object. The unit interval can be defined as a terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor of the category of intervals see the examples section at http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/terminal+coalgebra but this is not a homotopy-theoretic construction.

The category of bipointed sets is very very basic and set-theoretic but the unit interval $[01]$ or equivalently $\mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}$ is the basic *analytical* object. But we can characterize this in terms of a simple universal property which only talks about *sets* ... More like a join than a smash. Martin Brandenburg: This is a very beautiful observation. I encourage other readers to take a moment to think about how this could be and what it is really saying. Martin Tom: I do not understand if you take any non trivial bipointed set there are a lot of different maps from it to $([01]01)$. Am I missing something?

It seems that it is good form for computation by the following comments of Paul Broussous. It's easier to see the maximality of $K^\times$ as an abelian subgroup of $GL_F(K)$. In fact if we select any element $\xi \on K^\times \setminus F^\times$ then as $K = F \oplus F\xi$ as an $F$-vector space. It is easy to show that any operator in $GL_F(K)$ that commutes with $\xi$ will act as a scalar on all elements of the form $a + b \xi$ with $a b \in F$ and therefore on all of $K$. Bonnafé does the calculation in section 1.3 of his text. I clearly should have coffee before commenting that should be $\xi \in K^\times \setminus F^\times$."

It only depends on the decomposition of $h$ and for that I chose the decomposition with distinct eigenvalues.  Notice I said ""eigenspace"" not ""eigenvector"".  So if $v$ is an eigenvector of $h$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_j$ then $v$ is also an eigenvector of $\alpha_h(t)$ with eigenvalue $e^{t s_j}$.  Then if $g$ commutes with $h$ there is a basis of eigenvectors of both but then being eigenvectors of $h$ they are also eigenvectors of $\alpha_h(t)$ whence $g$ commutes with $\alpha_h(t)$. Sorry my mistake. I was trying to fit your argument into the general setting of compact connected Lie groups but at this point it is not even clear to me when two commuting elements lie in the same maximal torus.

I haven't gone to look at the Goursat and De Donder references that he cites but it appears that calling it 'Cartan's formula' (which of course Cartan never did) is historically inaccurate.  My comment was mainly to speculate that the 1922 reference may be *why* we call it the Cartan formula today.  It's odd that Cartan didn't credit Goursat (or De Donder?) in his 1922 book since he certainly held him in great esteem. Alas I'm too bad at French and decyphering French math books. I'm far away from the library but last time I was unable to identify the magic formula in E. Cartan's book.

I am looking for a weaker condition since i would like just the two vector bundle to be isomorphic without caring about the flat connections. Ah I see I misread the question. It is a trivial remark but one should note that representations $\rho \rho'$ which are in the same component of $Hom(\pi_1(M) G)$ 
(in your case $G=GL(r {\mathbb C})$ but it works in general as well) are isomorphic as vector bundles. This gives a sufficient but of course far from necessary condition for an isomorphism of vector bundles. In particular you get finiteness of the number of isomorphism clases of vector bundles. E.g. in the case of $r=1$ it shows that all line bundles are trivial since $Hom$ is connected.  A correction: $Hom(\pi U(1))$ is connected if $H_1(M)$ is torsion-free otherwise it is disconnected.  Hi Misha thanks "
92270,"All questions  concerning   isomorphisms of vector bundles ultimately reduce to  questions  concerning  classifying spaces.    For example $BU(r)$ is homotopic to the grassmannian of $r$-dimensional spaces in an infinite-dimensional vector space.
 The equality of all Chern classes for higher rank vector bundle won't never give a sufficient condition anyhow. That's why I was asking about something which can be read directly on the representation... There is a theoretical method  involving  the classifying space of $\pi_1(M)$. The representation  gives a map  $B\pi_1(M)\to BU(r)$ while the universal covering gives a map $M\to B\pi_1(M)$   and one  has to understand  the homotopy type of the composition $M\to BU(r)$.  Things simplify a bit when $M$ is a $K(\pi1)$ so that $M=B\pi_1(M)$ the induced map $M\to B\pi_1(M)$ is the identity.  Ultimately you will have to deal  with the cohomologies of the group  $\pi_1(M)$. Unfortunately I really don't know this language... Even notations are obscure for me! Sorry..."

For projective varieties $X$ pulling back a vector bundle $E$ on $X$ to the punctured affine cone $C(X)$ gives you the equivalence between graded locally free sheaves possibly with a twist and vector bundles on $X$. By using local cohomology of $C(X)$ with supports at the vertex and an excision move you can sometimes relate it directly to the cohomology of the punctured spectrum where you have tools such as depth available.  Problems over the punctured spectrum of an arbitrary local ring are usually more general (therefore harder) than the same problem over the punctured spectrum of cone of a projective variety. If you can solve a problem (e.g. splitting of vector bundles) over the punctured spectrum of an arbitrary regular local ring then you get it for free for the projective space but the converse is not necessarily true.

More or less. To be sure there is a computation of the action of $U'_p$ in weight 2 on Fourier coefficients in Prop. 6.10 but the answer is in term of the transform of $f$ by some sort of Atkin-Lehner transformation which is not clear how to compute. Then in proposition 6.12 Gross computes the composition $U_p(U'_p(f))$ when $f$ is on the linear span of form of non-trivial nebentypus: this
cannot apply to my old forms $f(z)$ and $f(pz)$. The note after cor 6.13 says that on old-forms $U_p$ is not normal but I dont see where the adjoint is computed"

If the equivalence relation ~ is understood a monoid M with this property is often called group-like. If you think hard enough about the failure of associativity in the ""monoid"" $\Omega(X x_0)$ you will eventually invent the notion of $A_\infty$-structure. One point that is possibly worth mentioning: if $E$ is an equivalence relation regarded as a subset of $M\times M$ then $M/E$ inherits a monoid structure iff $E$ is a submonoid of $M\times M$.

92338,"Answer to 1) should be always true I think. However for 2) you need some sort of properness condition. More precisely if $F$ is not proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ then there is a curve $\gamma(t)$ such that as $t$ goes to infinity $\gamma(t)$ goes to infinity and $F(\gamma(t))$ goes to $c$. Since there can be only finitely many isolated solutions of $F(x) = c$your condition (2) will be violated. When do you say a map $F$ is proper? $F$ is proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ means that there is an open set $V$ containing $c$ such that $F$ restricted to $F^{-1}(V)$ is proper (i.e. for every compact subset $Z$ of $V$ $F^{-1}(Z)$ is also proper). E.g. $F := \mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}^2$ be defined by $u = x^2y - x + y$ and $v = xy$ (where $(uv)$ are the coordinates in the 'target').

Separately even if we have $\Pi^1_1$ comprehension which can form the set defined by the formula in this answer that set may not actually be the standard $\omega$ because there are nonstandard models of full comprehension that still satisfy induction for every set in the model. The trouble is that ""the closure of a set under a function"" is model dependent in FOL.  I don't agree about the point in the first sentence.

I don't know off hand under how general conditions it is known that GW invariants actually count curves.

So also $z^2E_2(z)$ is holomorphic and also $E_2(-1/z)$ is also holomorphic (except at $z=0$). So then the difference has to be holomorphic as well. In fact the formulas is $E_2(-1/z) - z^2 E_2(z)=-2 \pi i z$. But correcting with a non-holomorphic summand gives really modular transformation behavior. Weight-two holomorphic Eisenstein series aren't defined directly by the usual series which doesn't converge. Rather consider a larger family of Eisenstein series with additional complex parameter $s$ show meromorphic continuation in $s$ and evaluate at $s_o$ most likely to produce something holomorphic in $z$.

 sorry for $\mathbf{Z}$ the probability of return is $n^{-1/2}$ (exercise using Stirling's formula). So the behavior of $\delta_n$ should be between $n^{-1/2}$ and $n^{-1/3}$.

92407,"In complex geometry you have the usual de Ram and Betti cohomology groups and the analytic topology so in some respects you don't really ""need"" étale cohomology. For me the whole point of étale cohomology is that it exists over general fields (e.g. finite fields).  As for explicit uses outside the Weil conjectures étale cohomology groups come equipped with an action of the absolute galois group of the field in question and hence give rise to naturally occuring Galois representations which are of great interest to number theorists I edited the English a bit.   More important this is a very broad inquiry which allows for multiple possible answers even in the specific areas you mention.   In a more algebraic direction etale cohomology has been an essential tool in the character theory of finite groups of Lie type as pioneered by Deligne and Lusztig in the mid-1970s and exposed in several books as well as many research papers.

If any two pure states can be intertwined by a unitary in $R$ then any two states can be 'almost intertwined'. Let $R$ act as a vN-alg on a Hilbert space $H$. Let $P$ be a projection in the commutant of $R$. Take vectors $\xi$ and $\eta$ in $H$ with $P\xi=\xi$ and $P\eta=0$. Take the vector states on $R$ generated by $\xi$ and $eta$.

One friend that I consulted observed that if $X=[01]$ then $Y_{\infty}$ is not an F-space (in spite of having many subspaces which are F-sapces).

92544,"Thanks again that helps ! I think the type of categories you're describing correspond to either a posetal category or the indiscrete category associated to a set $S$; it's a groupoid like EG for a group G. In fact it's isomorphic to some EG. Fabian when you write $End_C(bc)$ do you mean $Hom(bc)$ ? If so the hypothesis that there is a unique morphism between any two objects means that $Hom(bc)$ is just a one-element set so the coproduct reduces to one object. If C is like EG which is a groupoid the image of C must lie in the biggest groupoid contained in $M$ (some people call it the interior of $M$). It's like a representation of G. So I don't know if your structure map $L(c) \to L(c') $ is invertible in $M$. What do you think ? "

In the higher dimensional case (or the general Banach space case) I have not seen the sets  $\|z -x_0\| + \|z -x_1\| \leq d$ studied. It is easy to see that these (sort of) ""ellipsoids"" are convex so I guess your question reduces to something like: *if the unit ball of a Banach space is strictly convex is the same true for all ""ellipsoids""?*  After talking to some colleagues over lunch the implied strict convexity of 'ellipsoids' was exactly the conclusion we drew too.

Ah I am sorry. You mean that $E$ which we still do not know to be a model category should be shown to have functorial factorization in order not to check (3).

Since in this case all inequalities are strict (or at least this seems to be the case according what derfred wrote so far) one can actually solve this exactly by asking whether the polytope defined by the non-strict inequalities $c_i-c_j\leq c_k-c_\ell$ has empty interior or not (i.e. is full-dimensional). This is certainly doable but it might be expensive if there are many inequalities in your systems... In fact how large are your systems ""on average""? Given any real solution $\{C_i\}$ of the strict inequalities multiply by a large enough constant so that difference between the sides of each inequality exceeds 2 then round each variable to the nearest integer.

Therefore it suffices to consider integer solutions of the non-strict inequalities $C_i-C_j\le C_k-C_\ell-1$."

Hopefully this may be easier than for a general polytope given that $Q$ has a lot of isometries (e.g. the ones coming from permutations of $[n]$).

So this feels very different from the variety of models of ZFC serving different philosophical purposes.  I really like the multiverse viewpoint and I think it's a beautiful perspective on set theory but for example large cardinal axioms tend to point in the opposite direction (of describing a single universe rather than a multitude of possibilities on an equal footing).  The fact that this question leads so readily to debate is a reason why the MO format is suboptimal. I like this topic a lot but it's more of a philosophical question than a mathematical question and I don't see it as admitting a clear-cut answer.

I don't ask for a proof in ZFC of every theorem from ZFC+AU but for proof in ZFC some other theorem (probably induced by an algorithm which transforms ZFC+AU theorems into ZFC theorems) corresponding to every theorem in ZFC+AU.

For example can we transform AU into some useful/interesting ZFC theorem? porton. AU is by definition independent of ZFC and as such cannot be equivalent to any statement which can be proved from ZFC. Andreas: That means the conservation result itself has to be proven in something that is itself stronger than ZFC+AU.

They usually do not send you the corrected LaTeX code although a few journals are willing to.  Instead they send you a PDF file to check.  Some journals also list the changes or provide a marked up file to show them while others do not (but they are sometimes willing to do so if asked).

So in Vamos' theorem the ""only if"" directly follows and the ""if"" condition is equivalent to the fact that every sub-extension of a finitely generated extension of $F$ is itself finitely generated. The latter fact is stated with no reference in Wiki's page on the 14th Hilbert problem http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_fourteenth_problem [of course I means $L_i=F_i$].

For the converse let $L\subset K$ be the field generated by a transcendence basis $x_1\dotsx_d$ so $B=L\otimes_F L$ is a localization of $F[x_1\dotsx_dy_1\dotsy_d]$ so is noetherian and $K\otimes_F K$ is a finitely generated $B$-algebra so is noetherian as well.

For example it is not clear to me if just assuming that the property P(`$n$`) : `$S_n$` is a polynomial in the `$R_i(X_jY_j)$` holds is enough to prove that P(`$n+1$`) holds. ps : I know the question is (unfortunately) a little vague; it is part of the question to make it less vague.

If you take $r=2$ then you're asking if for any $p$ there are $n n+1 n+2$ which are not quadratic residues. Is that true? Felipe:  Yes so far it appears to hold numerically.  I just tried p = 113117 for fun.  p-1 = 4*28279. When r = 2 s= 2*28279 I get |A+B| = 98903.  If r = 4 s = 28279 then |A+B| = 86330. The gap between A+B and Z_p seems to grow larger and larger as p increases.  Moreover it also appears that for given p and different factorizations of p-1 = rs as r and s get closer |A+B| gets smaller so the largest |A+B| seems to occur when r = 2 s = (p-1)/2. Maple is just too slow I need to write a program to test larger cases and see a trend.

""Computing"" a finite morphism means determining its degree and ramification type. This is possible in some cases (for example modular curves) and gives you a (geometric?) characterization of the genus.  I consider that the (arithmetic) genus of $X$ already has at least two geometric characterizations when $X$ is a curve. I'm primarily interested in characterizations that work when $X$ is not a curve. Another comment: I'm asking for a geometric *characterization* not simply a geometric property or a method of computation in some cases (although these are of course good to know). For instance I consider the last bullet point a very nice geometric characterization for the genus of a real closed 2-manifold as opposed to e.g. a characterization in terms of Betti numbers but I imagine that this is rarely if ever a good definition for *computing"

I almost put that comment into my response but then I started thinking about getting estimates on the biggest possible size of optimum and decided that it is a little trickier than it looks... Igor: The optimum is attained at a vertex of the polytope defined by the program which is a solution of a linear system consisting of a subset of the inequalities turned into equalities. As such it is polynomially bounded (in terms of bit-length of the numerator and denominator i.e. logarithmic height)."

Dear Charles: oh yes sure. I only mentioned both definitions as a warning to be careful with the literature. Severi's definition is still used due to the weight of tradition or because some formulas are prettier with that definition or because it is nice that arithmetic genus coincides with geometric genus for smooth curves or for other reasons. I find Fulton's characterization the most convincing as an answer to my question simply because it *is* a characterization and not merely a property. The axioms Fulton gives are (at least in my mind) clearly geometric in nature. I would prefer a more direct definition rather than simply an axiomatic characterization but I consider this answer worthy of acceptance if nothing more direct turns up.

The letter $p$ appears first at the bottom of page 190 and see then formula (4) on page 192. It seems to come from terminology from theta functions. Can anybody fluent in German understand more precisely where the $p$ comes from? род is a literal translation of ""genus"

Nock: By the way if you want to draw dots on complexes it is better to use `\bullet` than actual periods which give $Q^\bullet$ instead of $Q^.$: your periods look very much like dead pixels in LCD screens :P Nick: In my understanding injective modules (and injective resolutions) are useful for theoretical purposes but are rarely useful for actual computations; among other things they are almost never finitely generated.

Maybe I am wrong in something? I believe that the ""fibration"" of one complex ""onto"" another that you are thinking of is not a chain map. Or maybe I am misunderstanding you.

Certainly a complex $D$ that is free of rank one in degrees $0$ and $1$ (and boundary map an isomorphism) and $0$ in other degrees has the left lifting property with respect to maps that are surjective in degree one. Because maps $D\to X$ correspond naturally with elements of $X_1$. "
