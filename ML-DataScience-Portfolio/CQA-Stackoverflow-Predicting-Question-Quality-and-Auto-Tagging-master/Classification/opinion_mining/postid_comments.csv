88575,"Thanks for the comments; perhaps this is another way of stating my question: The structure of $k[U]_L$ as a $U$-module can be fruitfully analyzed by a construction involving $G$-modules so can a similar thing be done to understand $k[U]_C$? In fact the paper of Joseph that I link to above shows that $k[U]_L$ even has the structure of a module for the hyperalgebra of $G$ compatible with the $U$-module structure (the dual zero Verma structure) although I don't expect such a thing occurs for $k[U]_C$.
(cont'd) (cont'd) In the case of $SL_2$ the construction of Kumar shows that each standard module for $G$ (which in this case is just characterized by its dimension) occurs naturally as a $U$-submodule of $k[U]_L$. I would like to know if something equally nice happens for $k[U]_C$. Look at Kostant's paper that I mentioned above - he does exactly what you want for the $U$-invariants in $k[U]_C$. Ah okay -- thanks!"
88576,"Yes $F$ is self-similar exactly as Anton described.  Writing $F_{10} = \{x\in F \mid x_0=1 x_1=0\}$ and $F_0 = \{x\in F \mid x_0 = 0\}$ we have $F = F_{10} \cup F_0$.  Furthermore $F_0$ is a rescaling of $F$ with coefficient $\frac 13$ and $F_{10}$ is a rescaling of $F$ with coefficient $\frac 19$.  (This is just a fleshed-out version of Anton's comment.) The self-similar mappings are $F_{10} \to F$ $x\mapsto 9x - 6$ and $F_0 \to F$ $x\mapsto 3x$. Maybe I should clarify my follow up question: is $F$ in question a self-similar set? If so what are the self-similar mappings? Presumably the subscript $n$ on the last $x$ should be $n+1$.  Then at stage $n$ of the usual middle-thirds construction of the Cantor set when you have $2^n$ intervals of length $1/3^n$ each the number of those intervals that meet $F$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number (if you index the Fibonacci numbers appropriately) which is asymptotically a constant time $\phi^n$ where $\phi$ is the golden ratio $(1+\sqrt 5)/2$.  So I'd expect the Hausdorff"

88581,"Vaughn thanks. The wikipedia reference is very much in the direction I was looking for. I also edited as you observed. 
 I guess you mean that $\theta$ can depend on $z$?  (Rather than on $\theta$.) Also your original rotation should be $f(z) = e^{i\theta} z$ and I assume that in your definition of a new map $f$ you want $f(z) = e^{i\theta(z)} z$. If I understand your definition then this is an incredibly large class of systems and there's essentially no hope of a complete answer.  Two remarks jump out:  (1) to talk about ergodicity you need an invariant measure.  A more meaningful question might be whether or not $f$ is *uniquely* ergodic.  (2) the maps you define are degree 1 maps of the circle.  If you put a few more restrictions on $z$ so that they must be homeomorphisms then there's a very rich theory of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the circle. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_number for instance. Also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_map gives some idea of the richness of behavio"
88583,"Ah so simple! Seeing how this is a Vitali style argument my next question would have to be obvious: what happens when we remove the axiom of choice so the Vitali argument fails?  The argument doesn't seem to use AC since I'm not picking representatives here but using only the transcendence of the new reals over the ground model field. So perhaps it works fine as-is? Instead of powers you could also use multiples of the new real.

Or you can appeal to the [Hewitt-Savage 01-1-law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewitt–Savage_zero-one_law) which says that any measurable tail set must have measure 1 or measure 0. (A tail set in $X \subseteq 2^\omega$ is one that is closed under rational translations i.e. $X+s=X$ for all finite sequences $s$.)  The same argument shows that any filter extending the Frechet filter must have measure 0 or be non-measurable. "

So you want a continuous analog of the decomposition of matrices into lower and upper triangular matrices. I'm not a specialist but it seems to me that for reasonably nice kernels (e.g. Hilbert-Schmidt) the natural approach should be: pass to the limit in the decomposition for finite dimensional approximations and show that the sequence of factors admits a converging subsequence.   Pietro Majer: Matrixes can not be decomposed in a product of upper triangular and lower triangular matrices (look up Bruhat decomposition). You have to allow permutation matrices.

88628,"Sergey: Truly great work! Thank you so much.

I am still thinking about the details. In the meantime just a few remarks.

1) If I understand the example correctly to make `$Q_k$` contractible it seems that you want to start with `$(Q_1\partial Q_1)=(D^2\partial D^2)$` (instead of `$(Q\partial Q)$`). This change doesn't make much difference other than ensuring that `$Q_k$` and `$Q_\infty$` are contractible and either possibility seems to give an answer to my question.
 [continuation of comment]

2) The part about collapsing `$D^2\times [01]$` mapping onto $Q$ does not seem to work unless you replace `$Q$` by `$Q_2$` and only after implementing the change I mentioned in (1).

3) The numbers seem to be a little off in the last paragraph.

Sorry about the nitpicking. I am just trying to make sure I understand the example correctly by working out the kinks. I do have two vague questions though. Did the inspiration for `$Y$` come only from the example of Borsuk-Mazurkiewicz? Any advice on how to find relevant examp"

I learned this from pages 4-5 of an article of Ribet: http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/Articles/rankin.pdf. His method seems somewhat qualitative but the remark at the top of page 6 suggests that one might be able to get more precise control on these primes at least when $p>k+1$ and does not divide the level. Thanks all. Hi Kevin does this finite set of primes consist of those that divide the level of the form? If not what do we know about this set?"

It is not true that weak equivalences satisfy the calculus of fractions in general but this does hold after you apply the homotopy relation. Another good resource is the nLab article. Unfortunately I don't know how to make $W$ admit a calculus of fractions itself before applying the homotopy relation. Indeed this is one of the main motivations for having a model category to begin with- to avoid the calculus of fractions and set-theoretic concerns. There is something called a ""three-arrow calculus"" which works in any model category.  This is formalized in the book by Dwyer Kan Hirschhorn & Smith (AMS monograph.)  This is perhaps not the kind of calculus of fractions you would like but is probably the best you can do for an arbitrary model category. The simplest description of the homotopy categ"
88632,"Even when $a = 1$ and $b = 0$ there is no simple closed form for this. There is however a sizable literature on the asymptotics of such expressions; see for instance the discussion of the Euler summation formula in Concrete Mathematics by Graham Knuth and Patashnik.  Hmmm MathWorld suggests that $a=1b=0$ simplifies to an expression involving the Euler-Mascheroni constant and the digamma function but I'm unsure whether the latter can be computed efficiently.

88634,"Oh I see what you're doing now. I was being dumb. The ker df should have tipped me off. I was very confused at what some ambient space was doing. I usually call what you described an ""embedded deformation"" (maybe this is not standard?). To me an infinitesimal deformation of $X_0/k$ is a flat map $X\to Spec (k[x]/(x^2))$ with special fiber $X_0$. Hartshorne defines global deformation to be any flat map $X\to T$ where some fiber $X_t\simeq X_0$. My guess is that Naga wants specific conditions on T (integral?) otherwise every infinitesimal is global. OK my use of ""$x^2$"" was confusing since it also arises in $k[x]/(x^2)$ or equivalently in taking the linearization $df$. I should have used $f(x)=x^3$!"

Indeed the graph I proposed is homogeneous: Each node of level n has exactly k^n paths to the root of the diagram. But then I must admit that this poses some problem since this introduces eigenvalues for the associated adic transformation. So this adic transformation is rather an extension of the Bernoulli shift (probably a direct product with an odometer).  
 Thanks to both of you.

If this question is ""can this be given a canonical group structure"" then my answer is ""can you define canonical?"". I have problems with the rest of the question for similar reasons. But let me try and say something a bit more helpful. In the ordinary case the universal deformation space has a canonical point... ...in it namely the canonical lift. In the supersingular case I find it very very hard to tell one lift from the other especially if the lifts are $W$-valued; I spent ages staring at such things once and found it really difficult to tell any of them apart.

But I also think alvarezpaiva should elaborate the answer for two reasons: (1) it is good practice to write such elaborations (2) the few mouse-clicks the better. Viewing things this way one still needs to demonstrate that the Euler-Lagrange equations are the geodesic equations for the metric. Abraham and Marsden demonstrate this in Theorem 3.7.1 (page 224) but using coordinates which Giuseppe was trying to avoid.

OP: You're working over a principal ideal domain aren't you? Whenever you have $(abc)\in \mathbb F_2[t]^{1\times 3}$ with $gcd(abc)=1$ you will be able to (explicitly) complete this to a matrix in $GL_3(\mathbb F_2[t])$ (which in this case is the same as $SL_3$).

Willie's right about my goal: I'm looking for the formula for an interdistance acceleration $d^{2}R_{12}/dt^{2}=f( \lbrace M_{i}R_{ij}dR_{ij}/dt \rbrace )$ for some number of point masses like eight. In principle my only solution is to first numerically embed these eight points into space and then to calculate this interdistance acceleration but I was hoping for an analytic method (which could a"

88686,"Thank you all very much for your helpful comments. In the real case you need to change the definition of recurrence: there's 0 probability of ever hitting any specific point so you look instead at recurrence to a neighbourhood (i.e. a random walk is recurrent if for each initial point $x$ and for each $\epsilon > 0$ the walk almost surely returns to an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$. With this definition the results are the same as in the discrete case: the random walk is recurrent in 1 and 2 dimensions; and transient in 3 dimensions or higher. That was very helpful. Thank you very much. A related result is Rayleigh's theorem: start at the origin in the plane and make $n$ steps of length one with directions chosen independently and uniformly at each step. Then the probability of ending up at distance less than one from the origin is $1/(n+1)$. For an elegant recent proof by Bernardi see http://math.mit.edu/~bernardi/publications/Rayleigh.pdf.

The ""all $N$"" clause seems to indicate that he is including composite $N$ but for non-prime $N$ there are more than two cusps; maybe he just meant that there are only cusps. He refers to a paper of Ogg where the latter says that the then-known list up to $N=163$ ""may very well be a complete list"" of non-cusp points. Nowhere does he prove what you claim in the first sentence. Mazur does prove that if $N$ is any integer $\geq13$ then the only $\mathbf{Q}$-rational points on $X_1(N)$ are the cusps.

My understanding is that the algorithms for Heegaard Floer computations are not computationally practical for that number of crossings.

We can do stupid things like take some fixed polynomial $f$ with $f(0)=0$ and then put $f_i(x) = f(x) + a_i$ for each $i$.  Whether or not this is OK when some $a_i$ are equal is up for debate.  Essentially this pushes all the points of intersection between the graphs of the polynomials to the line at infinity in projective space. I mean for the $f_i$'s to br different.

Indeed if f is the permutation character then $\langle ff\rangle=\langle f^21\rangle$. The former is the dimension of the centralizer and the latter the number of orbits on pairs. From this one sees two transitive means the centralizer of W is C. "

If one allows only real radicals then the answer is that $\sin(\π a/b)$ (with $ab$ coprime integers) is so expressible iff it is constructible iff $b$ is a power of $2$ multiplied by a product of distinct Fermat primes; in particular nonquadratic radicals do not help. The reason for this is casus irreducibilis: ... it is easy to see that the Galois conjugates of $\sin(\pi a/b)$ are $\sin(\pi c/b)$ with $(cb)=1$ in particular its minimal polynomial has only real roots hence its roots are not expressible using real radicals unless its degree $\varphi(b)$ is a power of $2$.

But I asking that $N$ be a $B$-sub-module and so elements of the form $na$ for $n \in N$ and $a \in A$ may not be in $N$ so $n_1 a \otimes n_2 − n_1 \otimes an_2$ may not be in $N \otimes N$. So if I require that $na$ is in $N$ iff $a \in B$ would I get injectivity? Ago: If $A=B$ then your condition would be satisfied trivially. Still there are examples where the natural map is not an embedding (think of $A=B=k[x]/x^2$ $M=k[x]/x^2$ $N=\langle x \rangle$; Here $N\otimes_B N$ is one-dimensional $M\otimes_A M$ is two-dimensional but the natural map between the two is the zero map)."

  Could you make a more precise statement?  If you just mean why $f(t):=|t|^\alpha$ with $\alpha\in (01)$ is $\alpha$-Hölder the reason is that $f$ is concave hence sub-additive hence it is a modulus of continuity of itself (check

88968,"For Q1: it is enough to show that every graded module $M$ is an epimorphic image of a graded free one by an homogeneous map: just pick an homogeneous set of generators of $M$ and proceed as in the ungraded case.  It follows from that that there are enough projectives in the category of graded modules and homogeneous maps so you can compute Tors there. The homology groups will be themselves in the category (because your $R$ is commutative) and in particular will be graded. The usual well-definedness of Tor then gives you a naturality result for the grading. (By the way: your title mentions cohomology but you then refer to Tor... If you wanted Ext instead then things are a bit more delicate because hom(MN) is not G-graded in the obvious way unless M is finitely generated.) Thanks a lot Mariano!"

However it seems what is proved in lecture 7 is that the map $L\to \pi_\ast(MU)$ classifying the formal group law of complex cobordism is a *rational* isomorphism (this is indeed very nice using just the Hurewicz homomorphism). Then Adams spectral sequence arguments are used in subsequent lectures to prove the result at each prime."
89018,"Very very nice! Oh right--so no $\omega$-positive curves in an exact symplectic manifold in particular the 2nd-homology obstruction still is useful for closed curves in an open Kähler manifold.  Nice. the point is that often a non-kähler and hence non-projective manifold does not have any closed submanifold at all... so the hopf surface is a quite particular case... diverietti: How sure are we about that ""often""? The main examples of non-Kahler manifolds - Hopf manifolds and the Iwasawa manifold - are torus fibrations and thus contain submanifolds. The only examples I know of manifolds that contain no submanifolds are general tori and certain hyperkahler manifolds and both are Kahler. Gunnar: you might also know about Inoue surfaces which are compact complex non-Kahler surfaces of class VII with $b_2=0$ and which have no complex curves. Higher-dimensional versions of Inoue surfaces are the Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds which are non-Kahler and also have no closed complex subvarieties other than points see http:"

89032,"The definition of combinatorial square seems confusing. Do you mean to say that the row and column indices of the points of the square form arithmetic progressions with arbitrary spacing?

On the other hand it's not an $X\times X$ plane unless one $X$ is 4 and the other $X$ is 6. I'm assuming a combinatorial square is an arbitrary selection of $k$ rows and $k$ columns.  A variant of this problem is discussed at http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/791/grid-k-coloring-without-monochromatic-rectangles It seems that you are asking about $K_{kk}$ case of Zarankiewicz problem (if you want a square only in blue).

My experiments suggest that with a positive binary $f(xy)$ the set of numbers integrally represented by the quaternary $$ f(xy) + f(zw)  $$ is completely multiplicative if some $m$ and $n$ are represented then so is $mn.$ I know this for principal forms.

89051,"The first step in a proof is to notice that the vector field $X$ restricts to a vector field along each of its integral curves so we only need to work on one integral curve at a time. So without loss of generality our manifold is one dimensional. It is also easy to pull back to the universal covering space because completeness of vector fields is preserved and reflected by covering maps. You can then assume that your manifold is the real number line. You can use the flow of $X$ to parameterize the real number line so then $X=d/dt$. After that the proof is elementary. Indeed thank you very much for the details. It seems indeed reasonable; don't you have any textbook reference for this fact? It is also interesting to note that one does not need to impose that f is bounded below by a strictly positive constant (the rate of travel along the integral curves could be as slow as desired as soon as it is not zero!?)"

This is of course too trivial so you should clarify what you want  BS: Thanks. I added a generation condition for the map $M\to N$.

Jérôme A special case of your suggestion amounts to finding the degree 1 polynomials in ""closure"" which just means finding the points  x  lying in the topological closure of all the roots.  Off the top of my head I guess that to identify such $x$ one might consider whether the set $\{ f(x)/f'(x) | f \in S\}$ has $0$ as a limit point or at least something like that.  What has come up in various places is that one associates with a polynomial the probability measure on $\mathbb C$ which is equidistributed on the roots of the polynomial. Now the space of probability measures has a natural topology and limit points are usually very interesting and special; there are isolated points etc. Equilibrium measures of compact subsets arise this way."
89078,"Since the heat equation with the given condition has a unique solution and the convolution form is one of the solutions the answer is in affirmative.

For small $t$ such a $k$ would have to like the fundamental solution of the heat equation. At the same time $u(xt) \approx u_0(x)$ for small $t$. Near the boundary of $\Omega$ this cannot be possible.  This is possible inside the domain. For the Dirichlet problem that is indeed so (the question is copied from the formulation in the Krylov's book). The case of the Neumann condition must not be utterly different - one should study the existing literature to have a precise formulation."

I assumed (out of habit) the OP was working with a locally of finite type stack over an algebraically closed field. (that is indeed enough no?) I am unable to see where in the proof they pass from the assumption that geometric points have trivial stabilizers to the statement that the fibers over all objects have trivial automorphism groups.  The step that they skip seems to be precisely the statement that is the subject of the question."
89118,"The nlab article on Schur functors is highly recommended http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Schur+functor. The message is that the category of Schur functors is just End(U) where U is the forgetful functor from cocomplete (or at least Cauchy-complete) tensor categories to categories."
89121,"My gut feeling is that this question is too elementary for this site which is for questions of interest to research mathematicians. You might consider posting to math.stackexchange.com. If I were assigning this problem I'd remark that isometries $f$ can be written in the form $f(x) = Mx + b$ for an orthogonal matrix $M$ and vector $b$ and remark that since the group acts transitively we can choose any old line say the $x$-axis and see which $f$ fix this setwise. This puts restrictions on $M$ and $b$ (find them!). Any other stabilizer subgroup will conjugate to the one you just found.  I disagree with ""For the point-wise case clearly only the identity transformation will work.""  What about reflection in your line (item 4 on your list)?   "
89122,"Alexander: it's just $f = e_1$ again. Note that the corresponding Schur functor is the identity functor. A better example is to take $e_2 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 x_1$ (I'll restrict to $3$ variables for simplicity) so that $e_2 \circ e_2 = (x_1 x_2)(x_2 x_3) + (x_2 x_3)(x_3 x_1) + (x_3 x_1)(x_1 x_2)$.

 Alexander: Schur functors are the things that can be composed. Decategorifying this construction gives rise to plethysm of symmetric functions.  Alexander: it is. See Proposition 2 on p. 23.  Qiauchu Can plethysm be described solely in terms of symmetric functions and what does it mean from this point of view ?  Alexander: yes if I'm not mistaken."

In this question I'm not looking for the closure of the class of context-free languages with respect to complements but merely to know if the proper sub-class of CF languages which have CF complements is in fact the class DCF of deterministic CF languages.

89145,"What is ""point fractal dimension""? $\;$ I don't think anyone will mind if you take the space to give a rigorous definition of what you mean by ""smoothed rho."" To smooth it out start with a time t_o and a point r_o = rho(t_o).  Find the maximum time t_1 such that there exists a circle of radius R that contains rho(t) for all t in the interval t_o < t < t_1.  So now we have a second point r_1 = rho(t_1) on rho. These two points are a distance R apart.  

Then repeat: Find the maximum time t_2 such that there exists a circle of Radius R that contains rho(t) for all t in the interval t_1 < t < t_2.  Repeat for all positive integer i. We can ""turn"" this procedure ""around"" to negative integers. 

Then these points can be joined with a continuous spline. Claim 1 seems wrong. With probability $1$ a random walk taking steps of size $1$ with independent and uniform angles will be dense in the plane. However I don't think the uniformity of the random walk is important.

89149,"D.Speyer: because the kernel is not a congruence subgroup. In his Traité p. 378 Jordan proves the following theorem : The solution of the general equation of degree > 5 cannot be reduced to that of equations arising from circular or elliptic functions. As far as I can see the proof boils down to show that the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_n$ with $n \geq 6$ is not isomorphic to $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z})$ for any prime $p$. After that Jordan also remarks that any equation can be solved by bisecting periods of hyperelliptic functions as Noam said above. So basically the answer should be 'yes' for degree 5 or less and 'no' for higher degree? Should be. But there are a lot of caveats in the above. I'm hoping someone will give a clear reference to clean this all up. Looks right.

89175,"Thanks for taking time to answer. However i cannot quite follow your reasoning as I am not into spectral sequences. What is $y$? Anyway I came as far as this: The tangential SW-classes of any projective bundle $P(\xi \rightarrow M)$ can be computed as $\Bigl(\sum \limits_{j=0}^k (1+a)^j q^*(v_{k-j})\Bigr) \cup q^*(w(M))$ where $k=rk(\xi)$ $a$ is the first SW-class of the canonical line bundle in $q^*(\xi)$ and $v_j$ are the SW-classes of $\xi$. Hence in our case $w(TP(V))=(1+a)^{2m-1}(1+a+q^*(v_1))$. Now my guess was that $a=q^*(v_1)(=x)$ which would make things simple. What do you think? Your $a$ is my $w_1(L)$ but I don't understand your formula for $w(TP(\xi))$. I would rather say it's $q^*(w(M)) q^*(w(\xi)) (1+a)^{-1}$.  This said I admit my spectral sequence calculation might be a bit bugged not beeing careful enough with filtration/gradation issues to give the correct algebra structure.

Even if some abstract theory will tell me that it is true the questions in my previous comment remain. The case $I = J = [1]$ is indeed easy. If $X \to Y$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}^{[1]}$ and $Z$ is the corresponding object of $\mathcal{C}^{[1] \times [1]}$ then we have $L_{11} Z = Z_{10} \sqcup_{Z_{00}} Z_{01} = X_1 \sqcup_{X_0} Y_0 = X_1 \sqcup_{L_1 X} L_1 Y$. Thus the canonical morphism $L_{11} Z \to Z_{11}$ coincides with $X_1 \sqcup_{L_1 X} L_1 Y \to Y_1$ and this morphism being a cofibration is equivalent to both $Z$ being Reedy cofibrant and $X \to Y$ being a Reedy cofibration (assuming that we already verified this at $(00)$ $(10)$ and $(01)$ which is easier).

89229,"Perhaps something like this would work? The ideal sheaf $I_Y(m)$ is generated by global sections for $m\gg 0$ by Serre's theorem. Fix such an $m>0$. Note that the general element in the linear system $H^0(I_Y(m))$ is smooth away from $Y$ by Bertini's theorem. So you are reduced to showing that the general element is smooth on $Y$.
 For curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ the following argument works: taking cohomology of the conormal sequence shows that global sections of $I_Y(m)$ give global generating sections of  $N_Y^*(m)$ which is a vector bundle on $Y$ since $Y$ is assumed smooth. But general sections of $N_Y^*(m)$ do not vanish on on $Y$ (since such such loci have expected codimension 2).  In case the complete intersection argument isn't obvious if the variety is a complete intersection then if one of the generators had vanishing derivatives somewhere on $Y$ the tangent space would have a dimension too high and form a singularity."
89231,"Thank you Karl.  So what you're saying is that I can find an irreducible hypersurface containing $X$ that is smooth away from $X$ even if $X$ is not a complete intersection? Parsa that's true.  Or for each point $z$ of $X$ you can find one that is smooth near $z$ (but then they don't glue).

If $M^m$ is a manifold $V$ and $W$ vector bundles on $M$ of rank $r$ and $s$. If $s$ is sufficiently large w.r.t. $m$ and $r$ then any bundle map $f:V \to W$ in general position is injective (use transversality). Now if $V^r \oplus R^i \cong R^{r+i}$ you have ...
 two bundle monomorphisms $R^i\to R^{r+i}$ one with $V$ as complement the other one with trivial complement. Taking any homotopy between them and put it into general position.

This doesn't rule out the possibility of having a transitive action of a Lie group that is not an action by isometries for any Riemannian metric.

There is Zariski-type Grothendieck topology on the category of affine schemes and the corresponding sheaves are schemes. This allows to associate a topological space to any scheme. The structure sheaf appears as a sheaf of morphisms from an open subset to the affine line (affine scheme represented by $\mathbb{Z}[T]$).

If $G$ is connected and compact and the rank of $H$ equals the rank of $G$ then there is a fibre bundle $H/T \to G/T \to G/H$ where $T$ is the maximal torus. By Hopf-Samelson the Euler numbers of $G/T$ and $H/T$ are given by the order of the Weyl groups hence both positive so $\chi(G/H)>0$.   If $H$ has smaller rank $S \subset H$ is a maximal torus of $H$ $S \subset T \subset G$ a maximal torus of $G$. The fibre bundle $T/S  G/S \to G/T$ shows that $\chi(G/S)=0$. The fibre bundle $H/S \to G/S \to G/H$ shows $0=\chi(G/S) = \chi(H/S) \chi(G/H) = # W_H \chi(G/H)$ and so $\chi(G/H)\geq 0$. Now I see this is also implied by Vitali's post...

In other words lying in a $K$-dimensional subspace is independent from having weight $k$. Pretty expectable! To comment just above --- if ""K"" is very big  e.g. extreme case K=N - so there is only one ""subspace"" which is space itself then of course number of weight ""k"" vectors is C_n^k so if ""K"" is something near it we may expect similar result...

Since $j^1_mf=j^1_mg$ just take the same representative for $g$. diverietti is of course right. $j^1_mf$ is by definition an equivalence class and you can't have an empty equivalence class. But you might as well write all the ""matrix equations"" out explicitly and write down explicit formulas for everything.

Up to an isometry your solutions all look like $(e^{a_1t}x_1 \cdots e^{a_nt}x_n)$ where $a_1 \cdots a_n$ are the eigenvalues of $B$.  So $x$ as a function of time is just the orthogonal projection of $(e^{a_1t}x_1 \cdots e^{a_nt}x_n)$ onto some line in $\mathbb R^n$ (the line depends on the eigenvectors of $B$).

Also minor quibble but if your process has continuous paths you get $S_t f(x) \rightarrow f(x)$ for free (and if you have the Feller property then you can show that you actually have $S_t f \rightarrow f$).

Perhaps the theorem is that an Ito process with the strong Markov property is a diffusion? George: Do you mean the example given by ShawnD? Maybe I misunderstood it probably he meant 0 to be a shunt (in which case it would be a diffusion however). I understood that when the process starts at x < 0 it gets reflected at 0 such that it always stays below 0. In this case I think that the process is not strong Markov because when stopping it at 0 one has to know whether it came from below or from above in order to continue.

Two remarks that might or might not be helpful: the limit of a convergent product is nonzero by definition (else the product is not called convergent at least this is a very common convention).

If you only care for the reals (as opposed to the complex halfplane) and the result you could just take the def via the series of postive terms whose limit is of course nonzero.

If the perturbation was not known to be of the above form then these other eigenvalues play a role in the estimate and hence the standard theory gives a bound on the error term that depends on $r$. 

But in this case the perturbation is such that the perturbed eigenvalue always live on the real axis and it approaches the limit from the right-hand side. Thus I think the bound on the error term should not depend on $r$ and... 
 And the convergence should be faster than that can be obtained from Kato chapter 1. Also this is an analytic perturbation so we should be able to write down some series expansion explicitly in terms of $\epsilon_{ij}$ and $k$.

I think the issue was in fact due to failing to saturate the ideal so that your description of the ideal didn't actually provide generators for the ideal in the local charts he was working.  Playing around in Macaulay I can't get any of the cohomology groups to jump whatsoever.   Perhaps this is the right way to fix the exercise:  instead of looking at $H^i(tI_t)$ look at $H^i(tI_t(1))$.  This clearly jumps over $t=0$ as there the curve lies in a plane while it is nondegenerate for other $t$. Thanks for your kind check with Macaulay.

See this is exactly why I needed to ask this question I thought that there was something that was THE canonical fundamental domain. The motivation behind the question comes from research on the topology and geometry of the universe. A lot of theoretical physicists consider the universe to be a closed $3$-manifold and so I was interested to see how we could discern what properties that $3$-manifold would have. If there was a correspondence between the group action defined by ""a"" fundamental domain and certain group action"

Thanks for clarifying.  Johannes is right. What you might be thinking is the category of principal  bundles over a fixed base is a $2$-colimit over all covers of the base (or some cofinal subset) of the categories of principal bundles over that fixed base which trivialize over the given cover. Gluing is an ordinary colimit so you can certainly think of it as ""some kind of 2-colimit"" if you really believe that helps you."

Also $F$ is a direct sum of its cohomology. That is you are basically asking if $\mathcal{O}_X\to \mathcal{O}_Z\oplus\mathcal{O}_U$ is a monomorphism. Is that right? Since sheaves on $X$ are a full subcategory of $D^b(X)$ if this is a monomorphism then it is still a monomorphism in the category of sheaves on $X$. This I think may fail if $X$ has an embedded point e.g. $X = \mathrm{Spec } k[xy]/(xy y^2)$ and $Z = \{0\}$ with reduced closed subscheme structure.

Let I be the ideal of elements of A which have finitely many nonzero coordinates. By Zorn's lemma I is contained in a maximal ideal M of A. What's the characteristic of the field A/M? If it were a prime $p$ then $p=0$ in A/M so $p$ is in M. But as a (diagonal) sequence in A $p$ has all but one nonzero coordinate. Use this and the fact that I is in M to show 1 is in M which is a contradiction. So char(A/M) = 0. You really should read about Witt vectors as Tom suggests. Although the construction in my previous comment leads to a (nonconstructive) field of char. 0 out of infinitely many fields of different positive characteristics Witt vectors are a mathematically more significant way to create fields (well domains) of characteristic 0 out of finite fields in a good (= functorial) manner.

91347,"In other words the problem statement as written is incomprehensible. We can try to make some ""educated guesses"" but it'll be much better if you clarify the question yourself.  Exactly what submatrices you want to count? What conditions $u_1$ and $u_2$ have to satisfy? Why after choosing $u_1$ columns you want the next column not to belong to their span? This is the logic I have? Alas the OP seems to have abandoned the thread so I'm voting to close as ""no longer relevant""."
91379,"For a Gaussian the entropy is a constant times the log of the variance (or standard deviation) and contains no more or less information than that. It's only when you allow non-Gaussian distributions that the entropy becomes a more interesting information measure. One characterization of the Gaussian distribution (say of mean 0 and variance 1) is that among all distributions of given mean and variance it has the highest entropy.  So the Gaussian solves a maximum entropy problem.  But I suspect that's not the kind of thing you're after.  Could you clarify what you mean by ""of any use""?  "

I am still interested in given a more general elliptic equation finding a form without such terms if one exists."

On the other hand this is maybe not as nice a construction as what you would hope for. Thx. What is $S.C(K)^H$? Well the product of these two subsets of $C(K)$ or if you prefer the $(C(K)^H)^{opp}$ submodule of $C(K)$ for the right multiplcation that is spanned by S (which is a $C(K)$-submodule for the left multiplication).

Poonen's notes www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/Qpoints.pdf it clearly states that the set of $k$-torsors is equal to the set of twists of $\mathbf{G}$ where $\mathbf{G}$ is the algebraic group $G$ endowed with its  right action  of $G$ given by translation. Aren't the twists of $\mathbf{G}$ the same as the twists of $G$? He means twists of $\mathbf{G}$ as a $G$-torsor not twists of $G$ as a variety. Ow I see. Well then it's clear.

The lack of categoricity for first-order $PA$ occurs only because we cut back the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered (since this is a second-order assumption.) What I'm really trying to say here is that non-standard elements only seem to creep in when you throw out the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered. I believe that categoricity of $\mathbf N$ means that all copies of $\mathbf N$ look the same within the universe but not necessarily the same as the external standard $\mathbf N$?

Maybe the solution is that we work in second-order arithmetic in which all the finite sets (of integers) actually exist as opposed to set theory?

Using the long exact sequence it is easy to represent the Euler number of S-D by the Euler numbers of S and D but we still cannot represent the Betti numbers of S-D by the Betti numbers of S and D right? At least we cannot find a universal formula... What it is true is that $\sum (-1)^i b_i(S-D)=\sum (-1)^i b_i(S) - \sum (-1)^i b_i(D)$.

Alright. I will. Over nonperfect fields there are nontrivial torsors for unipotent groups e.g. Exercise (3) top of p. 130 Serre's ""Galois Cohomology"" Just adding to Jason's comment that over perfect fields the torsors are indeed trivial.

It seems that there is no choice but calculate $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ and see what's $\lim_{(xy)\to(00)}\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$. On the other hand however if the function is smooth I can't imagine what $\frac{\partial^n F}{\partial x^n}$ would look like.
 Oops $(xh_x+yh_y)$ should be $(xh_x+yh_y-h)$ above.

92338,"Answer to 1) should be always true I think. However for 2) you need some sort of properness condition. More precisely if $F$ is not proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ then there is a curve $\gamma(t)$ such that as $t$ goes to infinity $\gamma(t)$ goes to infinity and $F(\gamma(t))$ goes to $c$. Since there can be only finitely many isolated solutions of $F(x) = c$your condition (2) will be violated. When do you say a map $F$ is proper? $F$ is proper in a neighborhood of $F^{-1}(c)$ means that there is an open set $V$ containing $c$ such that $F$ restricted to $F^{-1}(V)$ is proper (i.e. for every compact subset $Z$ of $V$ $F^{-1}(Z)$ is also proper). E.g. $F := \mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}^2$ be defined by $u = x^2y - x + y$ and $v = xy$ (where $(uv)$ are the coordinates in the 'target'). Then $F$ is not proper at $F^{-1}(c)$ for every $c$ on the line $v = 1$.  Did u mean $F^{-1}(Z)$ is compact instead of proper? Yeah! Careless mistake ... Is it easy to show a map is proper?

For me the whole point of étale cohomology is that it exists over general fields (e.g. finite fields).  As for explicit uses outside the Weil conjectures étale cohomology groups come equipped with an action of the absolute galois group of the field in question and hence give rise to naturally occuring Galois representations which are of great interest to number theorists I edited the English a bit.   More important this is a very broad inquiry which allows for multiple possible answers even in the specific areas you mention.

I am assuming ZFC. For the question I have asked a set is having PSP if it is either countable or contains a perfect subset.

Thanks. Are you working in ZFC?  If so you can take any uncountable universally null set as a counterexample.  If it contained a continuous injective image of $2^\omega$ you'd be able to push forward the product measure to contradict its universally nullness (nullity?). Perhaps the ""perfect set property"" is: given any nonzero finite measure $\mu$ on the sigma-algebra there is a perfect set $F$ with $\mu(F)>0$. I guess also require $\mu$ to be atomless. I assumed perfect set property meant the standard thing although in retrospect it's somewhat suspicious that projective sets are claimed to possess it.

So leaving out a countable subset does not destroy the property that each perfect set is uncountable. So for example $[01]\setminus (\mathbb{Q}\cap[01])$ might be a more interesting example. Unfortunately $[01]\backslash(\mathbf{Q}\cap[01])$ is also completely metrisable: take the distance to be one over the first index at which the continued fraction expressions differ."

It turns out primitive cohomology is defined completely differently but you couldn't even define it the way I thought it was defined because $\Lambda^2 \neq 0$ as $L^2 \neq 0$ for the reason Paul and Gunnar mentioned above. If $K$ is the Kaehler form then $K \wedge K$ is not zero as $K$ has even degree. If $K$ is a form of degree $p$ then we have $K \wedge K = (-1)^p K \wedge K$ by anticommutativity.

You just want it to be non-trivial? That seems strange. Why do you want such a cocycle? I would use $H^3(S_6U(1)) \cong H^4(S_6\mathbb Z)$. $H^4(S_6\mathbb Z/2)$ is known (Adem-Milgram) and the Sylow p-subgroups for p=35 are ablian or even cyclic. Thus the calculation of the mod-p cohomology of $S_6$ shouldn't  be to hard. Then I would  use universal coefficients to obtain (at least parts of) $H^4(S_6\mathbb Z)$.  When you say you want a 3-cocycle on $G$ I presume you mean you want a function on the 3-fold product of $G$ with itself; or do you want any convenient whatever that may mean  representatio"
92688,"So for example if your finite sum can be shown to equal
$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}\dx = \frac{\pi}{2}
$$
then you want to conclude that the original sum is not expressed as an elementary function?
 What??? $\sum_{i=1}^1 \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi/2.$ So: edit the question to be what you actually want!  As Igor showed any number is a ""finite sum"" with one term. I'd understand the question better if you'd give an example of a finite sum with a definite integral representation for which the indefinite integral is not an elementary function.  My interpretation is that the question is asking whether there is an elementary function with an elementary indefinite summation but not indefinite integral.  I.e. if $f(x)$ is elementary and $g(x+1)-g(x) = f(x)$ has an elementary solution $g(x)$ then must $h'(x)=f(x)$ have one as well?  I'm sure the answer is no.  For example if $g(x) = \exp(-x^2)$ then this amounts to asking whether $\textup{erf}(x+1)-\textup{erf}(x)$ is an elementary function.  Presumably it isn't but I d"
92694,"Voting to close as too localized (and so the site won't kick it back to the front page as no answer has been accepted). I assume Simon thought that the proof of his answer is too trivial to warrant mention but for what it's worth if $A$ $B$ and $AB$ are symmetric then $AB=(AB)^t=B^tA^t=BA$. And indeed this has been bumped up. Why wasn't it closed? What sort of conditions do are you looking for? if they commute is possibly the simplest condition.  If and only if they are commuting... Simon's condition is presumably the best possible answer.  Incidentally the ""right"" product structure on symmetric matrices is the Jordan product $A \circ B = (AB + BA)/2$ which reduces to the ordinary product if and only if $A$ and $B$ commute. This looks like homework"
92706,"Nicely done Miek. I can confirm for you that ""Joe's"" IP address is in Leiden. :-) Perhaps show the map $x \mapsto \mu(B(xr))$ is upper semicontinuous.  [Or if you use open balls lower semicontinuous.] What's wrong with Byron Schmuland's answer on math.SE: http://math.stackexchange.com/a/123691/? This is homework for the course http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~shille/FNA_2012.html and quoting from the FAQ: ""MathOverflow is not for homework help.""

92722,"It's not clear that ""corrections"" are done. Modification to conform to a ""house style"" is definitely done. I think this is off-topic for MO but the short answer is yes they change the formatting and also often copy-edit the writing (fix spelling grammar bibliography entries etc.).  They usually do not send you the corrected LaTeX code although a few journals are willing to.  Instead they send you a PDF file to check.  Some journals also list the changes or provide a marked up file to show them while others do not (but they are sometimes willing to do so if asked). They certainly extensively change the formatting and (often) provide copy-editing.  But some do even stranger things (for instance I've had at least one journal not request a tex file and instead re-type the whole paper)."

92739,"Have you looked at the Hilton-Milnor theorem?  It answers much more than your question.   By the Jocobi identity we have:

in which $[i_1i_2]=[i_2i_1]$ and $[i_1i_1]=i_1\circ \eta_2$\\
i.e. $$2[i_1[i_1i_2]]+2[i_2i_1\circ \eta_2]=0$$
Therefore the difference between $[i_1[i_1i_2]]$ and $[i_2i_1\circ \eta_2]$ is the 2 torsion part"

92800,"Internal logic makes a lot of things easier... it might be worth your while to become keen on it.  (-: Have you tried the internal logic? Martin: you're right sorry. I couldn't find much informations about the claim in the OP so I tried to prove that statement on my own. Let C be Barr-exact; Mon(C) inherits completeness of C and if I'm not wrong any internal-monoid can be factored into $m\circ e$ with $m$ a mono $e$ a regular (hence extremal) epimorphism. Here I stopped but trying to examine a special case seems a good idea... it sounded so natural to me that I wanted to obtain it once and for all in full generality.
Mike Shulman: your guess sounds good too. Unfortunately I'm not really keen on internal-manipulations.. :) Mike: any clue to begin? Perhaps you will get answers when you provide more background. Which sources have you already consulted? What's up with the special case of pointed sets? Etc. http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+logic maybe which contains some references."
